- Post Title: Extracting PS2 Game Graphics, (Burnout or any game!)

Is it possible to view or extract the textures or models from PS2 games? I would really interested if anyone has any examples of any game they may have managed to get into. If this is possible I would love to see Burnout textures and models.

Let me know if anyone has had similar thoughts or ideas.

Well PS2 games OFTEN use .DAT files.
tho SOME use different file types (Breath of fire ect...)
But there are AS MANY VARIATIONS of .dat in PS2 games as there are CREATURES ion the universe.
What im trying to say is that, a Program that works with ONE ps2 game will MOST LIKELY NOT work with any others, as the File system is different.
Also as of yet NO1 has been able to DECODE the PS2's MUSIC format, A few games MODELS have bene done, there is a TOPIC JUST FOR THIS its called something like "Hacked PS2 games" or soemthing.
I THINK its in the Completed Rquests forum.
Im not quite sure.

Actually they have and have a player specifically for that format.

REALLY?
WOW!
Whats it called?
Is it the SAME one that works WITH PS1 games.
Cos that one DOESNT really extract COMPLETE tracks its NORMALLY just instruments.
I mean a program that can EXTRACT the COMPLETE music files, at 1st as instruments but then (With some OTHER INFO) can piece them together correctly.

Well, somehow they have extracted the music tracks as a PSF2 format I believe is what it is called and they are supported by a number of players and Winamp plugins.
