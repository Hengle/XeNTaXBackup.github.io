- Post Title: Metroid Dread font files

I've been looking through the files for Metroid Dread lately and have found a variety of font files. Most of them are .bfonts, which I'm not sure how to open. There's one for six different languages or so, including English, Spanish, Russian, etc.

One file type that is very interesting to me is the .buct files. They contain the glyphs used for the Chozo language in the game, and would be really useful for learning how to translate those characters. It's a common trend for Switch file extensions to have b at the front. So maybe they're just encrypted whatever .uct files are?

Does anyone have any idea what the .bfont and .buct files are and how I might open them?

Update: From other research, the font textures themselves may be stored elsewhere. Annoying. This question may be better asked on another board.
