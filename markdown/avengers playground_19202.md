Does anyone know which of these file types is the true model file?

I'm not sure if the models are in the .bin files, or the .lulmodel files 

Any help would be appreciated

and you can convert all the ktx textures to png with PVRTexToolCLI and this bat file contents

```
for %%G in ("*.ktx") do PVRTexToolCLI -i "%%G" -o "%%~nG.dds" -d "%%~nG.png" -f r8g8b8a8
```

Wow, thanks for the info on the textures. About the models, will they all work on those settings you have in the screenshot, or does it differ per model, I'm particularly interested in the hulk model?


edit:  I ran the bat file with the ktx file, the PVRTexToolCLI.exe in the same folder and it made a small png file with nothing in it, and a corrupt dds file. Did you try with these textures?

all settings are the same except the step 1 and 3 start addresses and counts.
different models rarely have identical number of vertices and faces.

trick question? of course i did and they converted fine.

Not a trick question, are you able to send your .exe file, I tried one from github which is quite old, and 32/64 bit ones from the power vr kit. Does it need something installed to run correctly?

Thanks I found the problem, I just needed to put everything in the same folder then it works without having to install anything. The model part is still tricky though, is there a tutorial you recommend to follow for hex2obj so I can extract the hulk model?

no tutorial is going to help you here, the info you need is acquired from recognizing patterns and some trial and error.
you can use the given iron man sample to see what you need to look for in the other lullmodel files.

Thanks for the info, managed to get hulk based on what you had with iron man, but the others don't seem to be so easy. Does the pattern always have to start with 1 2 3 on the first line?

not always, but in these samples it does.
okoye is the only character that uses dword indices instead of word.

Managed to get nebula, I got the pattern on captain america to start with 123, and followed the same structure you used with iron man, and did the indices count calculation correct, but there is no mesh? I apologize for the questions, but this hex software is new to me so idk what I'm doing wrong. You have been a big help!

Hey, so I've been working to try and get all the models out of this since the recent update that added in End Game models too.
I'm a complete noob at Hex2Obj, but I've gotten the 3 shown previously out and Nebula, but I'm having trouble with others.

Black Widow in particular, I have her exported but her entire mesh is flat along one axis. Does anyone happen to know what could be causing that?



blackwidowparameters.png (14.29 KiB) Viewed 376 times


Her whole mesh seems to be there, just flattened.

Also is anyone interested in sharing the other meshes they've gotten out, or at least the hex numbers they used? Would be a great help!

Yeah I'm aware they're not meant to be flat, like I said I got others out I've just been having trouble with getting the right numbers on the rest. If you could pm me them that would be very kind! I still haven't seen Endgame yet, but I think Black Widow's model is from it. Or at least the head, the outfit might just be from Infinity War.

 I'm noob with Hex Editor 
I got some 3d Models from Marvel Avengers Playground AR Apk after Extraction.
i converted Iron man, captain america and okoye FROM .LULLMODEL to .OBJ by copying values provided by Acewell. in short i didn't worked in this process.
please someone help me in understanding Hex Software and process and how can I rip 3d models from .LULLMODEL using Hex editor and hex2obj.  
also post W.I.P. screnshots if it is possible especially when you find offsets, submeshes and uv offset
if someone is also interested in this topic contact these user they already did this:

Hi. I have extracted the Detective Pikachu AR Stickers using the Nosis plugin above. However, I'm having issues putting the extracted png textures on the model. I'm using Blender and the texture is covering the whole model, not part of it like it's supposed to. Plus, it's multiple textures. If you all know of a solution to fix the texture issues, please let me know. Thank You.

Coz the models are loaded as single meshes whose polygons are broken into discrete faces, thanks to which you can quadify the models with any 3D apps:

I have never had good quadify results but that looks super clean. What app did you use to do that?

You still don't get it. There's only one way to quadify these discrete faces, which has nothing to do with the algorithm or the version of the application. That means that any program abled to remove the shared edge of two adjacent triangles can do the job. Note that it works only for models containing at least 2 mesh groups.

Use this script for loading as grouped meshes.

I'll test that out. Thank You so much!
