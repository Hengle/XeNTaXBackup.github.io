- Post Title: Max Payne 2 (PS2) .RWS files

I am trying to convert the .rws streams from the PS2 version of Max Payne 2. I've tried extractor, Game extractor, and ADPCM Player. I have tried using MFAudio to no avail and ADPCM player which only lets me read and convert the music but not the SFX and voices, Those end up having two different channels with entirely different voices. I would like to get all the voices and the SFX from these files. Is there any type of program I can use to do this? I have seen RWSreader around but it's incomplete and I don't know how to use b/c it's not compiled. Below is a sample file of what I need to convert. If theres any other programs I can try, any help will be appreciated Thanks.

Here is a sample file: [http://www.sendspace.com/file/kjxqho](http://www.sendspace.com/file/kjxqho)

Wasn't sure which file hosting service to use. If there is a service that is preferred by the site please let me know. Thanks again.

runs files inside these RWS files. Set interval randomly, I set 1000.
You need to change samplerate depends on file. 32000, 22050.

But I have no idea how to split them all, because they are mostly all joined.
I made this research to find out whether these files sounds better than on PC version, but I think that they not.
PC version has good tools for ras unpacking.

PS. Max Payne PS2 audio files are also not better than PC imho.
