- Post Title: Cannonbolt model from Ben 10 Omniverse, help? (2 models included in the topic for later)

Hello users of Hex2obj.
I am so sorry my alt got banned! I'm not gonna take it anymore! And here's the link for the Cannonbolt model in case I need help for ripping and yes I did understand to rip Megawhatt's model.
Plus, I have another OV model called Heatblas_1____000000.et_DECOMP.

Two models of Heatblast and Cannonbolt, (plus notice in Omniverse 1, Heatblast's model are all the same for Young Ben and Teen Ben.)
Notice that I hadn't had Young Ben figured out yet.

These are Omniverse 1 models I found.
Heatblast and Young Ben can be done later anyway.
(Note me if I get a reply from a user of Hex2obj so I can understand to rip, because I'm not new at ripping anymore lol)
(and this isn't off-topic, it's a topic about Ben 10: Omniverse 1 Models from the XBox 360 or PS3 versions)
