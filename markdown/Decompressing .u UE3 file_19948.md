- Post Title: Decompressing .u UE3 file

Hi, I have a file with .u extension from Dirty Bomb. Game is supported by Gildor's UE Viewer and I managed to unpack most of the files but some of them are compressed with custom compression and I'm unable to decompress it. Well, one facepunch user managed to do it: [https://forum.facepunch.com/f/fbx/qona/Dirty-Bomb/1/](https://forum.facepunch.com/f/fbx/qona/Dirty-Bomb/1/) but he didn't show how he did it. Can you help me?

Here is the link to the archive: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/sclwx4dsx9lnm ... e.rar?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sclwx4dsx9lnmld/ShooterGame.rar?dl=0)
