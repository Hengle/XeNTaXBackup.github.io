- Post Title: Company of Heroes RGM Importer 0.25

I'm having some problems importing the animations using RGM Importer 0.25 for Company of Heroes.
The animations are very... wrong.

What will get the animations to play correctly?
Any other assistance would be greatly appreciated.

This is where the 0.25 importer is.

Really any help would be appreciated!
I might just be assigning the animation wrong. Can anyone with Animation experience in 3DSMax help?
