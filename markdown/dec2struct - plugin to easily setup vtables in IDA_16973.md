- Post Title: dec2struct - plugin to easily setup vtables in IDA

This plugin generates vtables by reading the class definition/declaration.
It simplifies work since you won't need to make it by hand so you're also less prone to mistakes.

It's hosted on github: [https://github.com/krystalgamer/dec2struct](https://github.com/krystalgamer/dec2struct)

To run it:
Press Alt+F7 and run the script
Select the file containing the class declaration/definition(the structures will be generated)
Now you can modify the type of any variable to the class(Press Y to do so)

Here's a before and after of me running it:
