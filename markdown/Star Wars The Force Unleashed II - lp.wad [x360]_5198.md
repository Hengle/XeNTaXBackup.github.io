Attached is the storm trooper from Unleashed 2. It is GTO, but the format is different. I hope that bones can be supported this time around. I have also included the materials, and animation.

How did you extract unleashed 2?

It's the same gto format, the file is just compressed with gzip.  Add a .gz on the end and extract with WinRar or use quickbms, etc.

Tried xbdecompress, it decompress original file to the file with header "LWAD". WinRar don't open it (((

Then take the .gto and change the .gto to .zip Easy breezy x2  (Special thanks to Chrrox for figuring it out) When you use the new GTO with the ripper the UV's aren't included.

Haha. Nice work. I just told someone they were three hours ahead of me on discovering and posting this. But you win by 5 hours. Good stuff.

Edit-- Or I should say Chrrox, I guess. Well that just means my time behind dropped even further. :/

Is anyone else missing half or more of the GTO's in the DLC folder?

I'm just happy that it was discovered. Bones are still and issue, as it's the same format as the first game. I also discovered that the TFU_GTO_Ripper deleted the UV's. When I export the OBJ from TFU_GTO_Ripper the OBJ causes an error importing into Maya. I have to import it into DeepExploration first, and then Maya, and I noticed that the UV's are gone 

 I have also read that it is missing some parts of new models from TFU2. The animation format is still compressed, so there is some work to be done, but I think it's well worth it.

I don't know if sound has been ripped yet.

Uber, my man. Can you ( or anyone ) here tell me exactly WHY the animation files almost always seem to be harder to pull? And since they ARE, generally, harder to get, (as far as I can tell, at least the newer releases) then why not compress or encrypt ALL files, like models with the same code? Or is it that more emphasis and time is spent on getting the models so these big brains have little desire left for the anim?

I ask because I have been STRUGGLING, with every possible way I have been able to find, to get some really top quality sword/saber animations. I have plenty of bvh files but they aren't doing the trick. I can pretty much animate to their equal and that isn't very good. To improve, I must study the more intense sequences, such as in TFU. 

I have even gone so far as to "green screen" a room or section of TFU, modded the character to be nothing but "tracking points" , recorded with Fraps, and imported into Movimento and tracked the motion. Needless to say, this is a pretty bad approach. Inventive, sure. But maybe the results are why no one else has attempted it (to my knowledge).I spent a dozen hours and got a whole lotta nothing special.

Hello everyone!

I hate to resurrect an old topic, but I'm hoping to obtain a method of extracting the models from the xbox DLC for TFU2. I had no luck with xbdecompress so I PMed the original poster of this topic, evin, to see if he could help. He let me know that the dlc files are not compressed and that the wad is just a container, but he has no unpacker for it. This is a view of the files:



Does anyone know of a method for unpacking these? Or would anyone be able to create an unpacking script? Please PM if you need more information.

Best regards,
dragbody

These *.wad files are already decompressed, to extract the contents open each *.wad file in a hex editor and put your cursor on 0x1000 and delete everything above it then save the file. The new header will start with "APak", then use QuickBMS and [THIS](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=53353#p53353) script by aluigi to extract the files. 
The extraction will be incomplete since the script only extracts the files from the first name table. The script needs to be modified to scan and extract all of the name tables which are scattered throughout the archive. 
I believe (not confirmed) the LWAD chunks at the beginning of the file define the size and location of each name table within the archive. 
You could extract the files by hand if you're in a hurry. Search for the hex value 9f 02 00 00 to jump to the beginning of a *.gto model file, but i don't think we have any viewing or conversion tools compatible with the 360 version of those files.

hello, sorry to necro an old post but I didn't think it would be right to start a new one on the same topic. So using the tfu2 quick bms script it doesn't matter if you remove the rename the files from .wad to .lp. Quickbms and the script will extract the dlc content either way. Just not the anything past what has already been discussed. 

here is a few screen shots  in hexedit of the different sections in the files with gto/dds files. Anyone ever get around to expanding the script to extract those files?







I know it's been a few years since this has been discussed, but some people still have hopes of converting the dlc to playable pc content and I really want to figure this out. Any ideas?

here is a sample .lp with the quickbms script that only extracts the first section of the file if anyone wants to take a look at it. I guess it just needs to keep searching through the file to continue extracting the next sections? the .lp.wad doesn't matter, quickbms still opens and extracts the first part regardless if its .lp or .lp.wad

sorry, update the url, first one was to an empty directory.

Quick edit, found some files in the dlc that might help...not sure. I've updated the sample file to include these files along with the partial quickbms script.

I'm also sorry to bump an old post, but I know there have been a lot of improvements in the talents of people around here since the TFU2 dlc was released. Could these files be extracted from the PS3 files, for example? Or is anyone willing to take another crack at the DLC wads?

Keeping my fingers crossed...

work in progress bms script to try and get everything split from the wad file in the lwad table  
i also added the apak unpack stuff that we already had even though the apak is one of the files extracted with the lwad table.


 SW_TFU2_X360_DLC_wad.zip
(787 Bytes) Downloaded 50 times


the lpmd file has some names in it, just need to figure out how to link it all together   

looks like there is some mixed info in this thread too and it is spreading to other sites like a bad cold.   
the normal TFU2 X360 *.wad files might be compressed, but the TFU2 X360 DLC *.wad files are not. 
the TFU2 X360 files are likely not identical to the PC version and will not work with existing tools, 
because of endianness etc so new tools might have to be made or modified from existing.

hey acewell, been digging into this one myself, and getting nowhere.  I think everything hinges on figuring out the first 4 bytes after the LWAD string (you're calling it HASH in your script).  It's likely that one or more of these bytes point to the lpmd string table you found.

Never mind, not all of the wads have those tables.

OK, getting super frustrated with this.  I've spent the last three days trying to figure out how to get one model, Jedi Leia, from the Endor DLC.  I've tried bms, I've tried hex hacking, I've asked zaramot, apparently the only person in existence to ever figure this DLC out, for help, and nothing.  Searching online has been fruitless, as the Xentax and Facepunch forums are the only places that ever come up.

People have successfully ripped models from other Xbox games.  What is so different about this game that it seemingly can't be done?

Sorry to necro this.

In this forums they describe how to make the models go from GTO to useable formats, but alas this was written for the original game [http://warcraft3ft.clan.su/forum/32-22909-1](http://warcraft3ft.clan.su/forum/32-22909-1)  you will need to use Google translate on the page since it is in Russian.

Has any more progress been made on a script to read the 360 DLC files? 

I have them on my machine and been trying to open them up but get stuck on the lp.wad files and renaming them to just lp or anything else causes the tools to fail. 

My guess is someone needs to find the correct offsets so extraction can happen at the very basic level. 

I am no good at this stuff. I look at HEX and get googley eyed.  It would be a good start, at least we could have some files out.

Has anyone found or made a bms script to get the lp.wad files?  The script for starwarslp.bms extracts no files whatsoever.  Also the entry data in the hex edit doesnt exist.

The short answer is, no.  The problem is that the model data is scattered around the files, and no one has figured out how to piece them back together.  I was able to successfully pull some static meshes from the PS3 version of the files, but I don't think anyone has looked at this dlc since.
