- Post Title: NBA Jam on fire edition DIFF file?

Hello all. I've been starting on an NBA Jam texture project and would like any user suggestions. I extracted the AST files contents with the OPenBMS script from aluigi user on here. It worked to extract all the texture files - I have the files, file name is correct for players, file size seems correct for textures, but there is NO extension. I have no idea what type of file these are. Importing into photoshop or Maya with various popular extensions has not worked so far. Anyone figure these texture files or any EA NBA Jam files out yet?

edit: perhaps they are DIF files? For example, a file title will say:  CHANUCEY_BILLUPS_HOME_HEAD_DIF 
Electronic Arts - EA - does have a DIF file type according to this link: [http://eblong.com/zarf/blorb/iff.html](http://eblong.com/zarf/blorb/iff.html)
but that says DIF files are for databasing and not imaging.. something along the lines of an IFF would most likely be an image. Anyone know conversion methods for a DIF, DIFF, or IFF?
edit 2: FWIW, Tried an IFF file converter and it did not recognize any of the files as graphic files. Could they be DIFF database files with multiple images packed inside? not impossible i guess. anyone?
