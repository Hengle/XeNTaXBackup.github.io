I have been wanting to at least get the Tyrannosaur from this game.... yet I have had no luck in even gaining acsses to any of these models due to it being a .unity3d file.... can someone help?

your sample is only 127 bytes  , even if you could open it any model
or textures wouldn't be worth chasing because the file size is so small.  
the files with models and textures are in another package some where
