- Post Title: Argo Files

Hi @ll,

im new here and I aren't good in File Research things, but i found out, that the gamefiles are based on knight-online (knight.mgame.com).

I found some parts of the Sourcecode on web ([http://gse.lbho.net/Client%20Code/](http://gse.lbho.net/Client%20Code/)). The only different I see so far, is the xbin file format, but the data structure seems to be the same.

I already have found the Model Extractor([viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6393](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6393)), but I want to open the other files, too.

I'm not very good in C++, so may you can do something with the source.

Dear,
  Seberoth

P.S. I hope my english isn't too bad

What other things?

But some of the code is useful, especially the texture viewer.
