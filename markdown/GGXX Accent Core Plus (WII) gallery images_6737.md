Hi all,
I'm trying to decrypt the *.bin image files from GGXXACP and I'm really lost, the only thing I can see is 0x26=Width 0x28=Height, I have uploaded a zip file with a *.bin file and a bmp of what it is.

If you want more examples just tell me.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks

Sorry for the double post, anyway it wasn't 4 hour, but 3 days.

The problem is there are some files that look like discarded material, so I can't rip them with the emulator (because they aren't shown in the game).
I though this was the right forum to ask for help, but unfortunately it seems to be a little dead
