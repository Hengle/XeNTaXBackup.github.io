- Post Title: Killzone 3 vertex compressed in model space

hello!

watching the data from killzone 2 & 3, I found all textures inside the corestram files and  3d models data inside the core files.



This Core files from the game contain 3d models and other data + textures in low resolution. 

[http://www.mediafire.com/download/82tt5 ... lzone3.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/82tt571sizrrkp1/char_killzone3.rar)

is possible convert the meshes to obj?

thanks!

I found vertex data in the end of the core file using the assets_description.characters.hgh_scientist_hgh_scientist_character.core file but looks like a 2D UV 



someone can help me to for find the other vertex data? (3D vertex)

here is the single file:

I obtained information about the vertices are compressed in "model space" with fixed points relatives to bounding box.

anyone know about "models space compression"?

If you mean it needs to be scaled by the bounding box its the same as resident evil 5.

I don't know much about this. I received a little hint which says that the vertices are compressed in model space... I don't know how to decompress or scale but I'm getting more information.

Note: Models from Infamous 1 PS3 looks very similar (infamous 2 formats looks similar to uncharted/the last of us)

Solved! I found the correct vertex data
