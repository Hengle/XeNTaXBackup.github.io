Hi,

All the files are compressed in the .pack file in the game folder.
And I don't have a script to extract them by QuickBMS.

I don't know which version you have, but in GOG version (v1.4.6-GOG),
there are no any ".pack" files, but there is one big PAK file

which can be easily unpacked with "unreal_tournament_4_0.4.25.bms" script.

Also, texts are not compressed, they are inside "Dialogs" and "MovieAssets" directories.
Just look for them.
