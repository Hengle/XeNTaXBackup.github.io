Hi. I want to get the textures from this game. I already have a script for extracting the models, but I don't have one for getting the textures. Can someone help out?

Here is a silly script to export some dds files. Put quickbms in the folder and drag the .ps3 to the .bat. Press "r" when needed.
I'm not sure this will work with other files.

It doesn't work. It says "xmath" is an invalid command.
