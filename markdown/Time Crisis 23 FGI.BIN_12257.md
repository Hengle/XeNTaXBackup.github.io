The FGI files contain all game resource data,file header called "PS2D". The file name only display in ps2 executive files.
For example:

> /cygdrive/c/_ta/Tcproject/sound/se_tc3/469_ev_os_m_gr.vag

I am sure there is a bunch of MPEG data scanned by cube media but the MPEG flags are invaild
You also can extract BGMs with MFaudio, view game texture with texturefinder.
But what is the actually archive format?
