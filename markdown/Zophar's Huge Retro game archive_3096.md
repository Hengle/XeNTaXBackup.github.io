Not to mention all the file formats to be explored... (or do ROMs not work that way?)

Hehe, actually, no, Well, and yes. In a way. There's not just ROMS in there, also disk images and tape images. Those will have more or less generic structures and you can get the files on those disk images. These could be graphics, and in case of the 16-bit computers, like Amiga and ST, you can have specific file formats, like IFF, JPG and MPG. But in case of 8-bit, a lot of the files represent something known only to the executable, and in many instances everything was loaded into memory by the same executable. You will have to disassemble them to see where everything is for in the file, where in memory it will be placed and how. Only then will you find what parts of the file were used for, but this is different for each executable, so there's no way to approach them with some generic file extractor.

Hehe, sounds like if modern game companies really wanted to discourage hacking, then, they'd go back to doing games 8-bit style...  Even so, though, at least the 16-bit games have something that can be looked into.
