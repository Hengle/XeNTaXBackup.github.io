Recently ive been trying to modify Goldfarmers "rouge_sdf" tool [https://github.com/GoldFarmer/rouge_sdf](https://github.com/GoldFarmer/rouge_sdf) To work with Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle

At first glance the changes that needed to be made seemed obvious: offsets.

But after changing the offsets and rebuilding i run into a "Going beyond file" error.

Perhaps they changed more than i first thought.

Below is a link to a .zip file with a couple of the files used by the game for anyone that wants to have a look at it.

Just to note that I am extremely new to code and all that sorta stuff. So it's also likely that I just messed up changing offsets i guess.

Any help would be amazing.

Quick update on this:
The changes are now apparent and someone is helping me with a tool to extract this stuff.

Basically they changed compression from zlib to zstandard and changed the file entry tree structure a bit.

Not yet im afraid.

We ran into a big issue relating to chunks that could prevent the tool from being made at all
