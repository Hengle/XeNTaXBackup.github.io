If you have sample archives you should upload those.
I doubt anyone's going to DL 4.5 GB without having any idea whether it is worth the time/money or not.

Unzipped Perfectly (That part was easy)

Folders contain Geometry, Textures and animations all  in .bin format

Anyone care to look at converting them to something Usable for blender or 3dsmax?

Chroxx,

Yes, that will be very useful once we have the meshes.



this utility will export to dds, png, etc, and also convert back to .bin

Thank You!

Hello there. I was wondering is there anything new concerning the model format? Have anyone managed to get to the models?

I've checked low-poly sample of orc model from earlier posts, need more samples. Maybe I'll try to download the game to see what I can do.

I think I'll return to this game someday, I have mesh import with bones+weights, so everything works. But! There are a lot model parts for charachters+LODs, and they are joined into one single mesh, there are no meshcount or vertcount/facecount for parts. So it will be a trial to separate them lol

Machinima Studio Can view and export models, But I've had some trouble with some of the models and textures I was looking to export, maybe because the client I'm using is newer than the version that is supposed to be the supported one IDK.

Supported version 2.0.02.77
Version I'm using   2.0.06.65.1

Can't find the older client anymore.
