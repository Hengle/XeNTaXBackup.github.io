- Post Title: Halo 4 models

are old tools capable of extracting Halo 4 models? I don't have the files with me right now, but I hope 343 didn't change the assets too much for this game. if the old tools don't work, should people start looking at this now or later? will microsoft go down on us for digging their most recent games?
