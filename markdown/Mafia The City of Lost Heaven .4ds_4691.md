I'm making mod for Mafia One and have request.

What i need:
1. Convert characters from *.4ds to format with weight data support (*.dae,*.fbx,*.smd)
2. Convert characters back to *.4ds.

What i have:
- 4ds 3d Max import script (attached with sample of *.4ds file of main character) created by russian developer Mr F. It support mesh/bones/dummy (but not weight data)
- zanoza modeler v1.7 can export models back to game, but, unfortunately without weight data.

Yeah, I badly needed a 4DS IO script for Max, as it is only available for Zmod, of which I'm not comfortable with, interface-wise. It's been almost a decade since the game first came out but still there ain't no character mods or scripts for other modeling apps.
