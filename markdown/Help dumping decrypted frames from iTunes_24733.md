- Post Title: Help dumping decrypted frames from iTunes?

I have many shows and movies on my iTunes account however I want to be able to play the videos-
I purchased the right to access and download without DRM and iTunes

Currently the only way  to remove Fairplay DRM is with Tuneskit -
Which, probably just records the video and re-encodes it.

Does anyone know of a way to dump decrypted video/audio streams from memory?
Widevine is not an issue but Apple's DRM is extremely hard to find any info on recently.

Most probably because that's the way people who have access to breaking Fairplay, want it to be.
If anyone has any additional info it would really be appreciated!

If you have actual links to working tools DM me

It is likely that iTunes on Windows is using "Protected Media Path" (which prevents you from dumping the data in memory) and on Apple platforms its using some special Apple stuff that does the same job.

I'm locking this thread; we don't support piracy here.

I understand that there are legitimate, legal uses for such capability as this, and personally I also don't agree with the whole "piracy is bad" shtick, but the potential for abuse is far too great and painfully obvious, and as a website we cannot allow such things to be discussed here.
