- Post Title: Jumper: Griffin's Story (PS2) .PAK

Hello, I'm trying to extract the voices from the Jumper game, I tried on Xbox but sounds are XWB/XSB and no one seems to know how to extract them, so I'm trying with the PS2 version of this game except that I don't know how to extract the DATA.PAK file, nothing worked after using multiple scripts with Quickbms, so if anyone know how to extract it that would really help me a lot, thanks.
