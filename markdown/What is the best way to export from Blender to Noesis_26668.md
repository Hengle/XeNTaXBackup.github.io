- Post Title: What is the best way to export from Blender to Noesis?

Hi there.

I've run into an issue where I need to export from Blender into Noesis. Blender's default FBX plugin is causing me some issues once I export from within Noesis. I'm running into issues with Blender's other default exporters like GLB and DAE where they mess up the bone order.

I need this bone order preserved. BetterFBX for some reason garbles it. Does anyone know of the ideal way to go from Blender->Noesis?
