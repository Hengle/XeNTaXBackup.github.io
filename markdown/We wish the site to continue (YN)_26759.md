Dear XeNTaX community, 

It is time for another existential poll. 

After 20 years of spending funds on this site (I started it in 2003) I feel it may be time to close. 
To be honest, today, in 2023, we have no funds coming in to sustain the site. 
20 years ago, I paid stuff out of my own pocket, and along the way, we were able to keep it up with some community donations. The past years, however, I am adding my own funds to keep the site up and running, despite this PayPal sign up top. 
Honestly, I don't feel troubled by it, and gladly pay from my own pocket. But, 20 years is a long time. 
And something has to give. Nothing is for free in the end. 

The final release of MultiEx Commander passed mostly with no one noticing: [http://www.xentax.com/?p=1334](http://www.xentax.com/?p=1334) 
I said the final release won't be up for a long time, and now the day is approaching that I will no longer host MultiEx Commander. That day is June 10th 2023.

All of this gives the impression that the site is for a few people only, and no-one talks about it, posts about it, supports it, promotes it.

Hence, the poll. A simple question. It will determine the end date of the Forum. It will not have an influence on our Discord, you can still lurk there: [https://discord.gg/UMFd7MFX2k](https://discord.gg/UMFd7MFX2k)

Let me know the verdict. 

The poll will run for exactly 64 days.

I think it deserves some discussion, especially since in appearances the site was superceded by a clone, zenhax, and discord itself. Discord itself being somewhat of a problem because it's SUPER closed and creates a memory hole. If someone decides they don't like the discord server itself or someone inside of it, it's likely it, and everyone inside of it could go missing more or less instantly. There's been instances where I've seen someone join, spam illegal content, self-report, and every user inside of it gets banned. Not fun.

Unfortunately, I'm also far too broke to support it, having recently suffered more severe financial distress myself. 

As a result, I'm unsure what to submit.

EDIT: I think in this case, it might make things easier to reduce the scale and make the site a simple archive in which case, which you could transfer to peer-to-peer or the wayback machine. Things going missing from the internet when it benefits everyone like this is... harmful.

I personally don't go to the forum for general use, it's more when I need some tool or comments about the operation of a game that one of the first options that pop into my mind is xentax, I think this could be the case for several users also giving the impression that few care about the forum, but in reality I already think of xentax as a baseline for reference in game modding and I think it remains extremely relevant for us, sometimes when I have a fast doubt I just ask in the discord server too, but isn't like I forgot the forum.
So, my vote: Y

I think multiex has to compete with QuickBMS but I also do not wish this website to disappear. Maybe it could be downsized?

Backing up the forum is a good idea, regardless of whether you take it down or not so I agree with that.

If the money isn't an issue, I say let it run. But if you're not interested or not able to cover it, just let it go. Everything does have to die at some point. Perhaps in it's stead some kind of wiki could be created to flesh out the available tools and notes from users over the years.

In my humble opinion, Discord does a lot of damage, XeNTaX Discord server should have never surfaced in first place, I can understand why one would like Discord better, no one has to pay a dime to use it while the forum costs money to maintain it.
A archived version for the entire forum and its attached posts contents would be a great idea at least, assuming it will indeed be gone for good.

Also, it would not be a bad idea for us all to get an idea how much the forum costs monthly to maintain so we can have an idea what to do moving forward.

I don't know about the others but I never forgot about this forum, there was only one problem in this case and the copy they made of it, it's not exactly a copy but it still affected the forum....
As time passed, the forum gained more and more information to the point that nowadays, instead of creating a topic, people can only search through a magnifying glass and find what they want 
I don't think discord was the reason the site is understaffed, I may not be a veteran here as I just joined this year
So I'm going to speak from my experience...I quickly learned a lot of things about modding without COMMENTING almost anything, this forum is amazing... It was a gateway for me and others to learn modding I know I don't comment much...But I care a lot about this site because it helped me on this journey. Helped me much more than the famous "gbatemp" or Brazilian forums

I'm sorry for my English I'm not American so I may have misspelled some words or not expressed myself correctly, I wanted to help financially but in addition to not having money, the dollar inflation in my country is up there, almost a luxury car kkkk

What are the costs of keeping the forum going?
If its say $100-200 a year for example, i think a few of us could provide some support without a problem.
If its like 1000 a year though, it'd require more people.

I couldn't agree more. More info about this would be recommended so we all know how to proceed, i personally know nothing about how to run a forum/website in general and its costs, there for, more info needs to be provided.

At the very least, I would like an archive, a read-only copy of the site, something like that. And that's only if you decide to pull the plug.

I won't lie, my first use of this site was for a one-off thing when I was barely a teen and needed help understanding reverse engineering. That was nearly a decade ago (edit: 8 years!) and now I am a full-fledged game preservationist in my 20. Despite this, I think I only posted on this forum one other time across those years. To be frank, I'm not going to post very often. The only reason I'm here right now in this thread is the Discord @. I rarely visit here on my own accord.

Still, and this is where the desire for an archive comes up, this site has proven itself incredibly useful when I need to dig up data from some obscure title nobody has heard of, or get tips on some oddball practice that I would have never thought of myself. This place has a wealth of information for old games and reverse engineering, and every once in a while, I just so happen to stumble upon a thread while diving through Google on my latest problem. I may not contribute here much, but this place is one hell of a library and I'd hate to see it completely disappear.

Xentax forum has a special place in my heart, this is the place I've learned reverse engineering. 
I log in to this forum every day to moderate content, ban spam bots etc.
So my vote is of course - Yes, I want to support it.

As for donation, I had several attempts lately to transfer money by paypal to xentaxfoundation account,but unfortunately I failed.
Something may be really wrong with my paypal account (or maybe with Mr Mouse account?).
Paypal seems very restrictive if it comes to payments, so maybe my debit card was blocked? I don't know.

So as some people suggested on discord server, maybe it will be a good idea to create Patreon account?
I would definitely try another support options (like Patreon).

Another idea is to try to cut the costs like:
- move xenax wiki to some free hosting server like [https://miraheze.org/](https://miraheze.org/)
- move multiex download to some free cloud storage (google drive, mega.nz)
- move xentax forum to some cheaper hosting server
etc etc.

I'm not nearly as active as some on here but I've been mostly a ghost just learning/finding out how these tools work etc. Tbh it would be a damn shame to see such a helpful one with mostly helpful people who're still around since near beginning offering tips/hints for newbies showing up to the scene. 

As someone else suggested worst case at least archive the site; biggest thing I've noticed with other things is once they're gone its almost near impossible to get those things back or find a person who may of saved it to begin with unless the site itself points you to it.

I've seen the donation option but I also wasn't sure how badly this site was needing it either; as demanding as it might be sometimes an actual goal tracker letting ppl know where it is met and not met helps a lot.

And Discord is a blackhole for information, you can't google it (content only visible with registration) and you are limited on how many you can join. And being able to find information is important.

If its say $100-200 a year for example, i think a few of us could provide some support without a problem.It should be doable for ~$10 a month I think, def more towards $100 than $200 a year. Unless the admins require a lot of support from their provider, that usually costs extra.

I am one of those 'silent lurkers' and not usually active per text, but this site has helped me a lot in certain ways and I'd be more than just sad to see it go. 

Thus: Of course I'd therefore be absolutely happy to support it, too! Getting an idea about the monthly /yearly costs would be ideal, so those of us wanting to support it, can get an idea on how we can best get together to do so.

this place is legendary but i fully understand you,i'm here since 2004   damn,so old 
if in any case you close it,i hope that a backup copy of this place will be done as it's a great part of reversing games,codes and so much more,it's history ressources for actual and future reversers. 
all my greets!

This.  There is no good reason to create a xentax discord server if the forum exist. Discord servers are not wikis, are not files hosting and are not good substitutes for forums. It's nothing more than a chat service. A forum it's more organized in relations of topics, so it's much more easy to find good informations than in discord. I don't care if discord has a "create a thread" option, those values informations shouldn't be confined in a random discord server, they should be in a public site where anyone can see it.

Here is my proposal... deleted the discord server, or just lock all the rooms and archived the server, this will make people start to post here more for information instead of discord. This is non-negotiable, either do what I am proposing or we will just move to a more competent site.

While I haven't logged into the site for many years, I'll echo the other users that both the forums and the wiki remain a valuable resource. At the same time, the community has moved to other platforms, and as much as I lament the decline of the open web, I don't see a path forward where forums like these will ever become relevant again.

So, Mr.Mouse, if you feel you are no longer motivated to host this site, I won't blame you for it. The hosting cost can be covered but the maintenance and moderation remains. However, I politely ask that if you decide to close the site, you give ample advance warning, and work with communities like the [Archive Team](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Main_Page) to ensure the valuable content is preserved. Thank you very much for building this community and offering a safe space for people to get into reverse engineering!

Hi folks,

I also voted that i will support the site in any way possible. This is not because of my Moderator status but more-so because of how much I have learned from so many people from this amazing community. It would be a massive shame to see it go then everyone forget but remember what we once all had. So please if you can answer the poll and also post what you need to.

In recent posts in this thread it has come to my attention that members here think the Discord server is the reason behind XeNTaX having low forum numbers. Though i disagree this is primarily the cause I am more than happy to shut it down at request and keep it archived. XeNTaX was purely originally a forum based site however the Discord extension was only created to modernise things. People were told in the rules on the Discord server to also post their findings on the forum but I dont believe they have. In addition, it was also stated the Discord would maybe be temporary to see how it goes.

All in all  I believe the Discord has been up for a while and I also don't believe it serves a purpose as it is not used widely to communicate anymore. When it first opened there was lots of good discussions.

I downloaded commander actually. I been helping for years on this site as Sharppy until Ghostblade decided to ban my account. And many others I seen on reddit. So as long as site is backed up I could care less. I even donated judgenmentnight1988@gmail.com via paypal. Some experiance I've had here. Better atmosphere on Zenhax.

If you would like Staff to look into this case about your old account. I am more than happy to have this escalated but please note. Multiple offenses against the forum rules which in your case has occured may lead to bans.

Thanks so much.

It holds no real value to the site as a whole. But if it wasn't for xentax I wouldn't have had the ability to access or mod lots of games that haven reinvigorated interests and emboldened love for them. If it wasn't for me even randomly asking for help for Gladiator RtFR I would have never been able to semi translate it and I'll always cherish those days. I wish I could contribute more and honestly mostly silently lurk and leech off others hard work. I still to this day wish I could figure out how to modify the csb files and compile them into ary but that's mostly a fairytale dream. I love everything xentax has done and contributed to the internet as a whole and if it ever goes down even if everything is archived will forever be a net loss to the niche modding communities.

I'll admit I don't know what MultiEx Commander is but I'll look into it.

All my love goes towards the owner and all the experienced users helping people like me.

I am too am one of the many silent lurkers here and have been following this site from 2017 onwards. 

Xentax has been a wonderful site for understanding game file formats and was partly responsible for inspiring me to get into modding games. even though discord is the preferred medium for a lot of people, nothing can substitute this site and the openly available nature of forums that one can easily access from a simple google search. 

Please continue keeping this site up and If I am having some income, I am ready to spare some of that to support Xentax.

Share the costs. I'm sure enough people will be happy to help. 

(and I do not like Discord for this matter as well, but I think this forum could use heavier moderation. Clean up the useless threads, set proper rules for help/request, give the releases more attention!)

Thank you all so far for the comments. 

- Just to restate, the costs need to be covered, yes, but that is not the most pressing at this time, since I've paid for them myself mostly the past two decades (though we did get more donations in the far past, so it could be done from those). Perhaps a Patreon may be a solution there. 
- I very much doubt that the Discord channel is impacting the forum a lot, since the number of posts per month have been stable the past years. 
- The number of new user registrations per year keeps growing, but that is because attachments to posts can only be downloaded by registered users. 

The biggest problem is the cost of time. Time costs a lot of money and energy. That cost is not reimbursed. 

Some responses and answers:

> I hink this forum could use heavier moderation. Clean up the useless threads, set proper rules for help/request, give the releases more attention!

That sounds like a job. Who wants to do the job? Any volunteers? 

> Here is my proposal... deleted the discord server, or just lock all the rooms and archived the server, this will make people start to post here more for information instead of discord. This is non-negotiable, either do what I am proposing or we will just move to a more competent site.

Wow. Rude. Get off your high horse there, partner. 

> What are the costs of keeping the forum going?
>
> If its say $100-200 a year for example, i think a few of us could provide some support without a problem

As said, costs is not the biggest issue, but there is also no room with the current hosting to offer any downloads as a site, the number of emails send through the site is capped, and yes, people forget the cost of time. Time to do proper site maintenance. Not included in the package, so I have to do these things myself. Keeping code up to date is the least I still do, barely, but to expand the site and implement new features? Look at the wiki.xentax.com. Good luck implementing the new Mediawiki code. No time. You need true webmasters for that. I could outsource it, but that will increase costs significantly. And I still would need to provide oversight. Time. 

> i personally know nothing about how to run a forum/website in general and its costs, there for, more info needs to be provided.

There's a lot you can leave to a host, but you need to know SQL, PHP and HTML at minimum, and general knowledge about webservers. 
Then you must be able to update code for the different websites, like phpBB for this forum, Wordpress for the main page, Joomla for another, Mediawiki for the Wiki. You need to be able to update to the latest php, and fix compatibility issues when thing go wrong. You build the websites yourself, build the correct tables, upload the code, test the code offline, any new feature you implement yourself or use extensions, that fuck up your code due to crap backward compatibility etc. So yeah, you can throw a host a bone to make sure basic stuff is in order, like security, bandwidth and emails, but the bulk of the cost is time and dedication. 
And then I haven't talked about site moderation and writing. That requires time on the hands of our wonderful moderators, that also do this in their spare time, since no-one is paid here. 

Perhaps the problem is more clear with the info I provide.

I discovered this forum when I was a teenager
in those years you had to pay to make a account
I was only able to create a account in 2015
but I learned a lot here, just by reading
I have few topics, but I learned a lot here
this forum helped me and still helps
made me learn 3D modeling and later game programming.

I would like to support and I believe many members will too
but if not possible, move xenax forum to some free hosting server or save in wayback machine
would be a good option.

So  during these years, for everything I learned here
to all the moderators and friends who helped me in the threads or in private messages  
thank you all
thank you xentax for the knowledge freely transmitted to everyone during these years
thank you.

The opinion of Shadowmael user is exactly the same as my own.
I don't comment much on this site, but I read a lot. I do not publish anything myself, as I do not have the necessary knowledge and experience to do so.
I did not know about Discord at all. But even if I knew, I would not use it, because it is not convenient (the reasons have already described above).
Unfortunately, I can't support this site financially either because of the huge difference between the dollar and my country's currency.
However, I would like, if possible, to keep this site alive.

I downloaded commander actually. I been helping for years on this site as Sharppy until Ghostblade decided to ban my account. And many others I seen on reddit. So as long as site is backed up I could care less. I even donated judgenmentnight1988@gmail.com via paypal. Some experiance I've had here. Better atmosphere on Zenhax.

Due to reasons we now discovered your Discord name which surprisngly you are also perma banned from there. I would like to add that i will further ban this account due to violations on both the forum and discord. The discord violation was so severe these bans will never be lifted.

Thanks for your understanding.

i think it won't make much sense to ask the people, most will always vote with "yes". at the end it still depends on you. if you believe that it's the right time now for the end of this forum, then go for it. there is nothing wrong with that

let's be honest: the old posts especially all the shared stuff is the most important and probably the most reason why people do create a account here and since there will be always some people who are interested, it will be always like that. if you think it's time for the end, then it's absolutely fine but we need a archive version of this forum. usually the archive.org waybackmachine is the #1 way to go if it's about saving pages BUT the problem with the waybackmachine is, you can't download attachments, because the registration is required

my solution would be: disable this, that it's possible to download attachments without registration and then making a full snapshot of whole forum @ waybackmachine OR you let the site keep running but only for viewing and downloading attachments, just like a archive. for example you can do it like this: [https://www.kernelmode.info/forum/](https://www.kernelmode.info/forum/)

actually the site would be down, but it was turned into archive version instead. registration is deactivated, no one can login or post, just for viewing. i really like this and i think this would be the best solution for a forum like xentax

That is correct. It is a bit of a silly and stupid question. But it does show the contrast quite clearly: a lot of users would like the site to continue, but only when it is free of labor or cost to them personally.

I am quite new to this site.
Obviously Xentax is a gem, tiny but elegant and very valuable. It's a golden mine for me.
Finnacially I'm willing and able to help, just establish a patraen page and I'll pay.
But I don't think there's any possibility that people can share your labor, at least not as willing as paying for the maintainance.

Most people took this site as a reference and downloading source, so can we turn the downloading limit from registration to payment? (maybe this is a bad idea)

I'm up to support the size financially, if that means giving a few â‚¬ every month. 
This place has giving me a lot of knowledge and opportunities, and I feel like it deserves some love from people.

Since it's not money you're looking for, but to not have to do the labor on your own, if the right people with the right skillset presented themselves, would you allow them do perform the maintenance tasks you speak of?

I have a lot of experience with all the applications and techniques you mention and software developer by trade and have a vested interest in the wiki and forum not disappearing. Only question is, how do you establish trust to let someone else in? Like many in this thread I'm mostly a lurker, using what people have already contributed for my own research, so I wouldn't have a track record you can rely on.

Xentax community massively helped me to learn modding, and I would like it to exist forever to provide the same level of support to others. However I understand how pressing money can be as it is a topic i've dealt with my entire life, so if the site has to go I hope it is archived atleast.  I wish you the best in this matter and regardless of your decision, thank you for hosting the site and thanks to everyone in Xentax for helping eachother out all this time.

The site is a valuable repository of information on how to extract models and assets on a per game basis. It would be a shame for all of that to suddenly disappear. I say start a Patreon and even pay wall some things behind it if necessary. But I would 100% give a little money each month if it means this place continues.

Mostly I see from the posts that it's all Newer people posting.
Probably can't do the work themselves and expect the Old Timers to do it for them.
I see a lot say "I'll support it" but how many actually have? IF everyone of them had already done that?
This thread would probably not be here now.
I didn't vote and I have no plans to vote. In my mind it's your site and only you can decide if it's worth your time to continue this.
I spent nearly 20 years doing Gaming Mods and I reached a point that it was no longer something I wanted to do or support.
So I walked away. 
Do what is best for you Mate! Knowing you left behind something fantastic and Legendary!

Thank You for everything you have done all these years.

It costs nothing to setup social media accounts, twitter, instagram, facebook, etc...

If you want to bring people here, it starts with social media. You need Xentax Twitter, Xentax Facebook, etc...
Search engine visibility no longer good enough.

Maybe even make the website mobile device friendly, if it's not already.

You make it seem like it doesn't cost anything. While I agree those platforms are good to have in terms of visibility, as I pointed out, the real cost is time and energy. People here seem to be willing to support, and that is great. If they would be willing to run these social media platforms, that would be wonderful. Simply saying "you should do this or that", even if sound advice, doesn't get the site anywhere. Since I do not have time to spend on the site, as I explained. And our mods are managing the forum and Discord in their spare time as well. At some point, time and energy is running low. For example, we have a Facebook account, but no-one managing it anymore. Again, it takes people who are willing to support to keep things going. No support, no site.

I'll echo the sentiments on hoping for an archive if the worst happens.

[https://forums.alliedmods.net/](https://forums.alliedmods.net/) is a site that I have given money to before. I don't give often but sometimes if I go there and get a good answer I give $5.

I cant tell you how many people are still, You cant extract that, its steeaaling *insert spongebob duck gif* But as a person that used to run a community i know how that ish can hurt the pockets, you've been at it for 20 years, that far longer than my 7.. and I had to hang it up lol.
Anywho, I agree with the other folks, the discord although fun isnt very good for research. This place is, sooo Wheres the donate button?
I'm broke at the moment but my money health is improving,How much do you need a month to run this joint?

If there's a patreon subscription for donations throw me a link it would keep a steady flow of income. This site is a collective of very ambitious and intelligent people and is top tier for sure. All things do come to an end eventually but just know everybody here appreciates what you've done. Not only have you gathered great programmers and students but definitely taught many men how to fish. In turn I think it's only fair that we all show our gratitude.

Correction: Mostly ambitious and intelligent. [and the cesspool of ungrateful]< (They're probably too young to understand.)

I've only joined recently, but I understand if the time investment of managing this site is too much. 
If it does ultimately shut down, I please, PLEASE ask of you to give some leeway beforehand to see if it's possible to have this site archived in some way, whether that be on the Wayback Machine or even the folks on the Data Hoarder subreddit, as it seems someone on there already started to back up what they can already. 

There's a lot of content/tools that's very hard to find outside here from older games from what I understand, seeing as my favorite game, Detroit: Become Human, has the only explanation and tools on how to decrypt and rip audio from the game hosted here as far as I know. That game's only about 5 years old as well, so I imagine there's a lot more niche stuff that's also only found on here too.

Discord doesn't seem like a very reliable backup though, especially considering the paid file upload limit, how much more difficult it is to search older posts, and the comparative ease of it getting banned by a malicious 3rd party. It is more community run though so I see the appeal from the owner's point of view. 

TLDR: I understand if the site can't feasibly continue, but please make sure all of the years of content found only here doesn't get lost to the shutdown, if it happens.

Actually this probably isnt very far off. I joined not that long ago really, and was very interested in learning how to fish for myself, but all the responses I got were more or less here is your fish or lurk moar

I think its really telling why it feels like this community is shrinking. I didnt quote the other half of your post, but I would ask, directly, in what way have you helped this community grow? Whens the last time you explained how to decode an exe to a newbie?

You build the world you want to live in, or in other words, you make the bed you sleep in.

If xentax is doomed to die, its the fault of xentax. I really do appreciate all the help I got here, but it really sucks how impermeable its been made by grizzled veterans and their toxic outlooks.

All this said, this place is one of those last gems on the internet before its all just 3 websites owned by corpos. I really do want to see this place succeed. Im not sure how to help with that, but I i'll try if I can.

it's always good to look at facts, instead of guessing stuff. 



years_posts.png (10.8 KiB) Viewed 500 times


30% of posts this year are done by users that are registered 6 years or more (check percentile 70% upwards). 
The median is at 2 years of registration, meaning 50% of posts are done by users less than 2 years registered, with 40% done by users that are not yet one year registered. 



users_year_a.png (9.24 KiB) Viewed 500 times


Of all 825 users that posted this year, 30% are here for more than 3 years. 50% of users have not yet been here one year. 

I do not think that this is different from the past years, though. Might be worth a look.

So that lines up with the assertion that tons of new people are indeed here, as was suggested. Interesting to know. So people are interested and finding the place no issues.

That raises the obvious question, why is revenue a problem. These people arent paying at the same percentages, clearly. Which begs yet another obvious question. Why.

That brings us back to my point, that I assert these new users are exposed to promises of cool game research, asset ripping, scripting, modding, but actually find toxic in-group culture hostile to their lack of experience.

What percentage of those new accounts ever post again after, say, 3 months? I think we will find that data will tell the whole story.

That is quite the statement to make. What is toxic in the outlook of these grizzled veterans?

I read you have been helped greatly with your requests for Startopia and Yager back in August 2022. You haven't posted since. One user did point you to the tutorials section, since you said you'd like to learn more. That section does indeed have nice assets to learn from: [viewforum.php?f=29](https://forum.xentax.com/viewforum.php?f=29) But then you were silent.

You now ask 05SpeedMaster (AKA Privateer) what he has done to grow this site. He started his first account in 2011, together he posted about 210 times in all, and has indeed helped out other people, looking at the 50 times he got thanks from them. 
So I would say he certainly did his bit. 

I don't know what you expect to get at this forum, but you certainly got help. If you are looking to receive a free course on reverse engineering to become as experienced as these veterans you talk about, think again. That is not what the forum is about, although there is a lot people do explain to others without issues. And there is the tutorials section to take up materials and study. People will not hesitate to help if users come with specific questions that show they have delved into the subject matter and got stuck somewhere. But taking someone by the hand cannot be expected from anyone that is doing this stuff in their spare time. It takes a lot of effort to teach. And the majority of people just want a quick fix. 20 years of this forum has clearly shown that. Many of them "demanding" that they are helped to see the nude model of Link in the latest Zelda game. Since they are sadly unable to do it themselves, boo hoo, these poor people. You see, members have a way of getting grumpy when seeing the ungrateful post their requests time and again. They are allowed that much. But if that is called "toxic", then I guess the forum is not for the ungrateful.

I've only glanced at the discussion, but I'll add my quick thoughts here anyway lol

XeNTaX is priceless, it would be a huge loss and disappointing to see it go.

If you have a Patreon or even just a PayPal, I'll contribute immediately, and/or on an ongoing basis as needed. I don't want to see this site shut down. (You mention there's a PayPal sign, is it still up? Sorry, I didn't/don't see it!)

I'm not a fan of Discord or social media such as Facebook. They can get overwhelming to participate and stay active in, and they just don't have the organization of a great forum. And others have made really great points in this thread as well. If you aren't able to maintain accounts on Facebook, Twitter, etc, I don't see it as a loss. I don't see those as being necessary to having the site and the forum.

Just the other day, I Googled a game, immediately arrived at the appropriate thread in the forum, and found what I was hoping for. (I haven't had a chance to play with it yet, but the resource was there for me, along with a couple dozen pages of discussion to read through lol.) And that's always been my experience with Xentax. So Google is definitely still relevant to bring people to the site.

I joined almost 13 years ago, but I haven't been active because I don't have as much time as I wish I had. However, I'm grateful and loyal to this site knowing there's this massive resource whenever I want to check out game files, including textures, audio, video, and text (and I know I'd get into 3D models too if I had more time). I'm sure at least some others are the same. They visit when they're looking for something, but they might not have the time to participate more actively. So yes, I guess I'm in the "quick fix" category, but I'm not the demanding type. I don't have the knowledge to build tools (or the time to learn about it), but I'm not going to demand tools from anyone. I don't think I've ever been ungrateful, I haven't looked up my old messages to see though lol.

If the forum is archived and closed, it wouldn't be ideal because people would still come to the threads and may have questions, and it would cease to be a place to share new tools and discussion. If you just rounded up all the attached tools and dumped them somewhere, it also wouldn't be ideal because of all the discussion in the threads, which generally aids in using the tools.

I would love to see the site and forum continue, and I hope that you'll let us know how we can help that to happen. All the rest (social media, etc), I wouldn't be concerned about. Getting down to the essentials, maybe it would be less effort required on your part. I've built a number of sites over the years from scratch with PHP, just hosted through shared hosting, I'm sure there's others with similar skills, if at some point in the future, you're looking for someone to take over the site. And as far as the costs of the site, I'm sure there's people who would be willing to contribute on a regular basis, maybe especially if you post a goal as others have mentioned. So all depending on what you need, I'm sure there has to be members who would be willing to contribute. But it would be a shame to shut the place down.

And Discord is a blackhole for information, you can't google it (content only visible with registration) and you are limited on how many you can join. And being able to find information is important.

Yep, that's what my biggest issue with discord is as well. And not only you can't google it, internal search in discord is not much help either. It does ok when searching for a single keyword, but if you need to search for multiple keywords, you run into problems because everyone and they dogs posts ~10-word per message. And the search engine will not analyze strings of messages, so if your keywords ended up in separate messages, you're not going to find them.

I do NOT decode exe files. I have almost always worked with the RAD Games GR2 file format. 
I have posted MANY 010 Scripts concerning the GR2 files (Mostly as Privateer), Helped work the SWTOR version of the GR2 format, and gave advise to Jayn23 as he worked on his Plug-in. So I may be one of the most knowledgeable members here for the GR2 files.

I don't recall many people asking me direct questions as to the exact format of the GR2 files since SWTOR or Jayn23.
There's a few threads that pop up now and then that I do answer as best I can.

Mr. Mouse has also answered you concerning me. What more do you expect from me?

There are many Members here that I admire that do General work on many file formats! And I see how many people request THEY do the work for them! Yes. That ticks a bad box for me. There was almost no one to help me understand the structure of the GR2 files! So I took the time to figure them out!
I have over 13 years invested in a file format, and it's various forms! Can you match that time investment?

I have worked with UbiSoft's Silent Hunter 3 - 5 since 3 came out around 2005. I am the expert at animations for ALL 3 version.
I helped create MANY TOOLS for those Games. And I saw the same thing there. I explain how to do it, People EXPECT me to do the work.
I did all that while I traveled the USA, did a full time job, bought a home, ran Multi-Million dollar job sites, and kept my family happy.
I'm not a young Kid hanging out in Mommy and Daddy's basement! 
I also owned and ran the first ISP in my area! Come back and tell me what you have done.

When you are able to HAND EDIT a GR2 file in Hex to produce something like this video? I'll listen to you.

Clearly you just don't get it do you?
Someone tells you to study harder and THEY are "toxic"?
OK. Fine. I'm just one Guy but you claim there are many creating this "Toxic Enviroment". You want to point out all the "toxic" members here? Please do so. Post your list of Us Evil doers! I expect to be at the Top of that list. Then see how many on that list will help you down the road.
It's easier to make enemies out of friends then to make a friend out of an enemy!

I'm done with you as your additude tells me all I need to know so I Thanked you.
Oh. And please let us know when some of your original work is copied into updates of Games and the Project Manager of that Game series flies half way around the World to meet you.

From what I've seen there are hardly any comments discussing the essential problem here: what's the purpose of this forum? You have a big banner on the home page claiming that this is a "Game Research Forum". So, I'll roughly divided the ordinary members in such a community into 3 types of roles: 
researchers: people with enough skills in reverse engineering of game resources and regularly publish their outcome to the forum;
requesters: people with bare knowledge in reverse engineering and mostly requesting help for specific games or topics, and those here looking for existing tools;
site moderators: people who maintain the site and ensure its normal functionalities.

What kind of interactions among members of different roles could occurred and possibly be beneficial for such a community? For interactions among researchers and requesters I can think of the following:
researchers to researchers: discussion and exchange on technical aspects, creating/sharing new knowledge with the community, etc. 
There's in fact a section called Code Talk which might be the closest case to what I'm trying to describe here, but after a rough glance on the topics this section appears to be polluted by user requests though it still seems to be code-related. Anyway, this might not be a common sight that you can see every day, especially when the top experts tend to work on their own projects and don't communicate with others very often. But at least I don't see any obvious obstacles that can dampen people's motivation to do so.
researchers to requesters: researchers releasing tools/tutorials to the community, handling queries from their users or audiences. 
This is the main aspect where researchers contribute to the community, and apparently what most users came here for. There are a lot of tools and tutorials published over the years and there might be more in the future. Only problem though, what's the major motivation for the authors to keep doing so? For tools release, I think it might be because they have an interest and pursuit in game technology, or because they keep getting positive feedback from the community and become addicted to it. But as a matter of fact, usually the author only gets 1 thank out of every 20 downloads of the attachment or even worse, which however is a common ailment of the Internet, not just here on XeNTaX. They just take, and don't care. As for me, I'm way passed the stage when such interaction can entertain myself as I find it unworthy and pointless to waste my time in exchange for getting my efforts mostly exploited by ungrateful a-holes you don't even know who they're. For tutorials it might be a different story as the way I see it, even though it could cost a lot of time to write a well-organized article, it also enhances your skills and abilities in archiving and summarizing things properly. And I do enjoy the pleasure of immersing myself in logical thinking during writing. On the other hand, the readers must undergo intellectual activities to understand and absorb knowledge in order to internalize it into their own skills, and such effort is worthy of recognition. There is one frustrating fact though, you don't get many audiences nowadays. Or maybe I've just underestimated their ability of comprehension, hence the lack of feedback.
requesters to researchers: requesters posting new requests regarding games or topics they're interested in, looking for assistance from the researchers. 
This is usually where it begins for a beginner to grow into an expert. People without decent knowledge of reverse engineering game models came here looking for help, after getting the first mesh entirely on their own, acquired an interest in game resource researching. They learned things along the way and even assisted others to walk on the same path. It's the circle of kindness, which also should be the most effective way of ensuring the sustainability of the forum. But we all know what reality is like. Indeed, you can't expect everyone to repeat the same trajectory, but please note that it is not an excessive requirement to ask you to contribute to this community to the best of your ability, coz every one of those dedicated to the forum had done their part and it's unfair that you take advantage of their efforts without contributing anything.
requesters to requesters: requesters helping each other by sharing information they acquired from the Internet or other forums, or the common sense that experienced people don't usually repeat. 
Though mostly this should be solved by doing a couple of forum searches or googling, I think we can have a little tolerance for that and trust there to be scenarios of proper use.

All these circumstances more or less exist in this forum and there might not always be a clear boundary among different cases. With all that being said, what I'm trying to emphasize here is, the prerequisite for the sustainability of a community is to ensure those who contribute get the respect they deserve, receive positive feedback and affirmation from the community, and make sure their good deeds to not be abused.

Even though building such a community is a long-term and arduous task, but if there are significant amount of like-minded folks, I think the question we should be asking then is, why we even think of closing the forum.

So instead of worrying about losing the existing contents hosted on the forum, I think we should be focusing on more fundamental issues, as once you ignore the people that actually created these contents, you're very much likely stepping into a dangerous abyss, clouding your judgement of where the future of this forum might be.

Following lines are only my opinions.

User problem:
I registered in 2014, my registration reason was only so I could be puny lurker who could download tools attached at user posts.
This "unique feature" still affects user metrics to this day. Users register only so they could lurk around and download attachments as well and then leave possibly never coming back.

Forum liveliness:
I noticed it as well, and I visit now and then. The cause might be IMO closed door modding Discord servers. They usually have only a few members and keep everything to themselves. I'm not saying it's a new problem, but might contribute to overall problem.
Another cause is main Discord server. Before, people asked here on forum, I think majority moved to Discord. Now they just join Discord and post something in general (abv.). Not saying to delete Discord or anything.

Money:
Not a problem, today's world uses wonderful and terrifying ways to get them.

MultiEx Commander:
Seen the new version post, but is it open source? I mean sure, 99.9% of users are running Windows OS, so seeing WinXP screen of app might give them retro feels. Others might be chased away by it and stick with tools like QBMS. I haven't used it once because of that. I won't tell you whenever to release source code or not, it's your app, but it might attract those, who would like to work on it in a future.

Site maintenance:
Gather a team who would willingly maintain the site. I won't speak about maintenance politics, it's a sensitive topic especially with DBs, but gather ppl who you can trust, we are not getting younger you know?
All I can tell for myself is, that I completely understand you, the more older I get, the less time I have for all of this.

I think that's all I can think of for now.

I will gladly donate to keep this forum alive.  I have been visiting here daily for years; it is one of my favorite online places. 

I don't like discord and will never use it.  

I host my own unrelated site and am familiar with the costs.  My site costs me a couple of hundred a year... how much would help you?  Ideally I'd like to be able to contribute enough that people could join for free in order to keep the community growing and the ideas flowing.

I'd take over to host but I can't afford the time to babysit a forum.  I tried and it was a nightmare.  I don't know how you do it, but I appreciate every moment.

Let me know how much and how,

Cheers

As far as I can tell there is no Discord "Invite Invalid". So that's not much of an alternative or helping anyone is it... (also it isn't and has nothing to do with social media, no idea why one person mentioned facebook etc) Most people who incorrectly use the word and cry 'toxic' are the constant flow of entitled beggars who ask 'can someone do the work for me like a servant and send me these files?' which is not what the forum is about. It would be nice to have more resources for newcomers to actually learn some reverse engineering etc if they so wish for games which do not have existing tools. At a minimum the site needs to be archived, remember facepunch an incredibly huge loss and xentax would be the same, dealing an incredibly huge blow to the community who have interest in this stuff as a whole. Also hosting/data has never been cheaper, is it really so difficult to get one or two hundred in donations? Or put banner ads on the site to help, who cares we can handle a few.

I do peak back in every so often and try to help others with their projects as long as its something I can do over the weekend. If the website does go away I will certainly miss that.

But logically speaking its probably time to let old things die, as AI becomes a larger part of how people search for information we'll see less and less people searching and joining old websites. Consider as well the larger the internet grows the more options people have to keep themselves occupied, soo user engagement will eventually dwindle.

The thing is the information on this site is extremely invaluable, to the point it would be criminal to lose it. 

The forum and wiki need to be mirrored or maybe consolidated on a platform like gitHub where the data can be freely accessed.

Anyway it's been a great honor, and shout out to chrrox for spending all his time teaching the community here and else where.

The final release of MultiEx Commander passed mostly with no one noticing: http://www.xentax.com/?p=1334 
I said the final release won't be up for a long time, and now the day is approaching that I will no longer host MultiEx Commander. That day is June 10th 2023.

June 10 is this coming weekend.  Is that also the deadline for the Xentax website?  What is the deadline for Xentax, if I may ask?  I assume you must make either yearly or monthly payments.

I'm not sure if you're referring to me here, but the reason it was mentioned is because the site owner was concerned about it. Mr. Mouse directly equated social media with "supporting" the site, which means it's being considered as a factor in whether to shut down the site or not.

Here's the TLDR of relevant posts:

> For example, we have a Facebook account, but no-one managing it anymore. Again, it takes people who are willing to support to keep things going. No support, no site.

And then I followed up on those comments by mentioning that I don't consider social media (Facebook as one example) to be important, such that I don't think it should be a consideration for whether the site is shut down or not:

I don't see those as being necessary to having the site and the forum. Just the other day, I Googled a game, immediately arrived at the appropriate thread in the forum ... So Google is definitely still relevant to bring people to the site.

Just throwing out ideas.  It's perfectly legal to ask for money for maintaining a website.  You could setup a gofundme.com page and ask people to support the website for the next 10-20 years.  People ask for money for virtually anything on that site, for paying rent or whatever, so your need is no less important than theirs. But, compared to most, you have something to give back, the information on this forum, so you have a one up.

Sorry,
I did just read only about 2 pages of answers (due to time constrictions) but I want to give my 2 cents anyway...
<premise you can easily skip>
I never went really deep in reverse engineering myself (even if lately I've been able to make a few discoveries on ff7 and ff8 camera file format and gave my very little contribution at least once) but, especially at the beginning, I've been an avid lurker of the tools and information posted here.
I think that being able to see how things were done in games helped me greatly to become a 3D technical artist and get to work in Game Development.
</premise you can easily skip>
I'd like to see the site continue to live and even if I've not been using it for a long time I'd like to make sure it will be here when sooner or later I'll need it again and I'm willing to give a little support for it (Patreon could be good but there may be a better/cheaper platform that would take less money from the community donations).

As for the "Discord is killing the forum" thing... maybe that's not 100% true yet maybe it's harming the forum somehow anyway.
Many people may find Discord easier and more convenient to use to discuss and then not bother to post the same stuff again here..so maybe many began to "skip" the forum entirely but this could start to create a black hole for freely available stuff.
I fully agree that all the "juicy" information should be available publicly and having them locked on a Discord server may be "limiting" so the solution could maybe be "mirroring" those on the forum using a Discord Bot or something... The best would be to have some sort of filter for the useful/interesting stuff but I know that everything requires time    

I think that being able to find this kind of stuff with a Google search is what makes many people like me discover Xentax in the first place and maybe Discord is not helping in that direction but maybe the solution is not just "kill Discord" but rather make Discord useful content more "open".

No. June 10th is just the date for MultiEx Commander. But it is more likely to be today, due to circumstances.

Just some more ideas.

If someone came to you and said, "Look, I'll pay exactly one year's hosting of your website, but in exchange, you'll have to put ad banners on the site.  This point is non-negotiable."  Would you be interested in that?

No, unless it would allow a paid admin of sorts. Since the main problem is, as I said before, time. Running a website like this costs a lot of freetime. And especially if you want dedication. I do not have that time. So what I need is people running the site, or even just take over the whole thing.

So I'm logging in after a few years to comment.... but I owe xentax a lot - it taught me to give back more than I take - as cliched as that is 

It would be awful to see the site go under, but at what cost to yourself mr mouse - have you had help running the site in the past (other than forum admins)? What did you learn?

All our time is precious - pragmatically speaking would it make sense to archive the site? And how would that even work?

so, I just want to say, that Zenhax has been down for a while now.

I can help with being a mod (not sure I have the authority to run the whole thing, not the time sadly as, for now, I run two jobs and a PT degree). Can talk about costs at a later date.

Just to clarify, mod duties in terms of being civil etc. My tech skills have improved somewhat, but not that much unfortunately. I was a mod for a time as well, don't think theyre was that much of an issue with my moderation, was it?

I will need to change my username however

I never liked discord, I am old fashioned, I prefer the forum over all else. In junction to this site for tutorials myself, there are just some things I can't do myself; I've gotten better at event programming, but other fields its good to have other help, so I seek aid via the market on Zenhaxâ€”nothing wrong with that. Seeing Zenhax going down terrifies me, and now xenhax for resources is a double whammy.

I don't want either to go down. I would keep it up; there's still things to be done, I've learned I've grown, I continue to learn and grow with places like these, and as a central game reversing site, it has to stay up. I don't want to even think about either site being a read-only copy. There is no other site like zenhax/xentax. Please don't let either or fall.

If xentax is doomed to die, its the fault of xentax. I really do appreciate all the help I got here, but it really sucks how impermeable its been made by grizzled veterans and their toxic outlooks.

All this said, this place is one of those last gems on the internet before its all just 3 websites owned by corpos. I really do want to see this place succeed. Im not sure how to help with that, but I i'll try if I can.

Yeah. True. I seek help and others to work with for their time helping me. For me, I'm a slower hands on learner, I try not to let it hold me back, I don't do well with just links to wikis sometimes outdated etc. or do not have anything for the specific game in question, but by working with another.

I can't but help notice you appear to have an issue with people here at the forum. 

That is quite the statement to make. What is toxic in the outlook of these grizzled veterans? 

But taking someone by the hand cannot be expected from anyone that is doing this stuff in their spare time. It takes a lot of effort to teach. And the majority of people just want a quick fix. 20 years of this forum has clearly shown that. Many of them "demanding" that they are helped to see the nude model of Link in the latest Zelda game. Since they are sadly unable to do it themselves, boo hoo, these poor people. You see, members have a way of getting grumpy when seeing the ungrateful post their requests time and again. They are allowed that much. But if that is called "toxic", then I guess the forum is not for the ungrateful.

This is part of the reason I avoided Xentax and used Zenhax. I haven't forgotten about Xentax entirely but this reason here kinda reminds me of why I stayed away. Games are specificâ€”not all the same; sure some general points may be transferable but games have different structures, don't use the same engine, some are console, PC, different architectures, and its always better to work with another to better learnâ€”paying for that time given.

Oh. And please let us know when some of your original work is copied into updates of Games and the Project Manager of that Game series flies half way around the World to meet you.

No, but the passive-aggressive nature is what keeps users like myself at bay. It's also why I never felt motivated to learn or get further into programming/reversing, because of this type of presence; I get itâ€”you're smart you know a lot, I don't help more than minimum, nope. Ok, it's better to pay someone then. But I want to learn too, the game I love and interested in how it all work as well.
I get it, being told to study harder with no material on that specific game gets nowhere. Ask for help and suddenly we're just not trying hard enough, everyone learning understand speed is different, especially with complexity of reversing and programming.

Leonora once said:
'Maybe it doesn't seem like much to some magical prodigy like you, but...!'

Know that for the ones who are trying, albeit slower, are at least trying, have a interest in learning how to do it themselves. Asking for help, having a nice template/tool for them to soar on reversing/programming themselves and learning is really good.

I explain how to do it, People EXPECT me to do the work.

I don't expect people like you to do the work. There is a section for everything, not here on Xentax, that is. Unless they're paying you and engaging with it to learn along the way.
If something I cannot do myself, I could go to the market and request help for that section there, paid for their time and work; nothing wrong with that; as I'm working with them, engaging and learning while paying them. I get it, it's not for some, but is for others.

[*]researchers to requesters: researchers releasing tools/tutorials to the community, handling queries from their users or audiences. 
This is the main aspect where researchers contribute to the community, and apparently what most users came here for. There are a lot of tools and tutorials published over the years and there might be more in the future. Only problem though, what's the major motivation for the authors to keep doing so? For tools release, I think it might be because they have an interest and pursuit in game technology, or because they keep getting positive feedback from the community and become addicted to it. But as a matter of fact, usually the author only gets 1 thank out of every 20 downloads of the attachment or even worse, which however is a common ailment of the Internet, not just here on XeNTaX. They just take, and don't care. As for me, I'm way passed the stage when such interaction can entertain myself as I find it unworthy and pointless to waste my time in exchange for getting my efforts mostly exploited by ungrateful a-holes you don't even know who they're. For tutorials it might be a different story as the way I see it, even though it could cost a lot of time to write a well-organized article, it also enhances your skills and abilities in archiving and summarizing things properly. And I do enjoy the pleasure of immersing myself in logical thinking during writing. On the other hand, the readers must undergo intellectual activities to understand and absorb knowledge in order to internalize it into their own skills, and such effort is worthy of recognition. There is one frustrating fact though, you don't get many audiences nowadays. Or maybe I've just underestimated their ability of comprehension, hence the lack of feedback.
[*]requesters to researchers: requesters posting new requests regarding games or topics they're interested in, looking for assistance from the researchers. 
This is usually where it begins for a beginner to grow into an expert. People without decent knowledge of reverse engineering game models came here looking for help, after getting the first mesh entirely on their own, acquired an interest in game resource researching. They learned things along the way and even assisted others to walk on the same path. It's the circle of kindness, which also should be the most effective way of ensuring the sustainability of the forum. But we all know what reality is like. Indeed, you can't expect everyone to repeat the same trajectory, but please note that it is not an excessive requirement to ask you to contribute to this community to the best of your ability, coz every one of those dedicated to the forum had done their part and it's unfair that you take advantage of their efforts without contributing anything.
[*]requesters to requesters: requesters helping each other by sharing information they acquired from the Internet or other forums, or the common sense that experienced people don't usually repeat. 
Though mostly this should be solved by doing a couple of forum searches or googling, I think we can have a little tolerance for that and trust there to be scenarios of proper use.[/list]

You should know that the majority of people thank silently, especially if the tool is from an older thread, or a locked thread they cannot post a thank you. It's very narrowed minded to think that users just take without thanks. If a tool already exists for whatever game they're here primarily for, that author is thanked; some post it, some don'tâ€”they thank vocally: 'hey look 'author' here has made a tool for X game, thanks/nice/'.

Comes down to if the tool was made a public release for users to grab and mod, or was paid made for specific use etc. Most attachements here are public releases. Either way, the author's work is undoubtedly appreciated and thanked. But know that most come here to mod and are searching for a tool to do so. Thy are not ungrateful, they all have different reasons/goals coming across the site. The main thing to know is that the work of author's publicly released tool work is appreciated.

As far as I can tell there is no Discord "Invite Invalid". So that's not much of an alternative or helping anyone is it... (also it isn't and has nothing to do with social media, no idea why one person mentioned facebook etc) Most people who incorrectly use the word and cry 'toxic' are the constant flow of entitled beggars who ask 'can someone do the work for me like a servant and send me these files?' which is not what the forum is about. It would be nice to have more resources for newcomers to actually learn some reverse engineering etc if they so wish for games which do not have existing tools. At a minimum the site needs to be archived, remember facepunch an incredibly huge loss and xentax would be the same, dealing an incredibly huge blow to the community who have interest in this stuff as a whole. Also hosting/data has never been cheaper, is it really so difficult to get one or two hundred in donations? Or put banner ads on the site to help, who cares we can handle a few.

This is why Zenhax's market section existed, because most have simple goals to mod or translate a game etc. or some have bigger projects and its just easier to pay and let the author(s) earn a nice extra income helping others who are undoubtedly appreciative. And it's certainly not for 'do the work for me like a servant'. You not being deprived and forced to work 24/7 on it without pay. They work on it on their own time, own pace and are paid for it.

so, I just want to say, that Zenhax has been down for a while now.

Please don't let the site go down. There is literally no other site like it; not even xentax. It may not seem like much with heavy activity but it is undoubtedly still active and cared for.

It was really a huge pain reading your context because of those large sections of nonspecific quotes. You need to avoid that next time.
Honestly I needn't have wasted my time in replying posts like that, but it's a good chance to make a point.
Across your comment I see that you're not good enough in reverse engineering so you pay people to do the labour for you. Well that's against the forum rules here on XeNTaX. Maybe some people do it in private but it's forbidden publicly here. So for the majority of people here whom you took the tools and the valuable info from, they're doing this for free and totally out of interest. Would it be an excessive request to ask for a little gratitude from the users then?

Now, regarding your theory of "the majority of people thank silently", that's the most untenable sophistry I've ever heard. There's a specific way to thank a user in action, by clicking the thumb button on the upper right corner of each post, right next to the quote button. I'm sure you must have noticed that. It's totally free, all you need to do is a simple click. An additional verbal thank through a comment can earn you some extra favor from the author but a verbal thank only without actual deeds of clicking the thank button on the contrary makes people doubt your sincerity. Fancy words just paled in front of real actions. So how much do you think it worth of your silent gratitude now? I'd rather believe that you merely don't have the courage to admit your mistakes than that you're trying to defense yourself. Wouldn't that be a huge disappointment if otherwise?

Nevermind. I take it back. I do not wish for the site to continue. This shows a lot about your character. I've never interacted with you until now and this is how you show it.
Precisely my point; I am more concerned about supporting zenhax. There was no need to be so rude, simply put.

Oh yeah, definitely exactly what urammer said. If not toxic, definitely bitterâ€”no point in trying to talk with someone of the sort, it won't go anywhere.

Bitter, sad and passive-aggressive, a triad of despair. I suggest seeking help for that, no need to take it out on me.
If Xentax inevitably shuts down, I wouldn't be surprised why. Maybe work on the inflated ego and perhaps you won't be so high on your horse and angry.
And I specifically stated I don't use Xentax, hence why I've only had 5 posts here. I know Xentax doesn't have a market section, duh, that's why I use Zenhax. But that is not the core reason why I avoid Xenhax, that reason is the serpent coiled before me.

I see perhaps you want everyone to be your constant beck and call, craving the upvotes/likes/thanks instead of doing it for the love of the game you're reversing. You should know, if you're not doing this via a paid job, or instead because you, yourself wants to, for your own love for the game(s), is it worth it?

That's a decision you can only make. And you should know, in the real world, not every user here is going to upvote/thank the post when they come here searching for a specific info/tool for the game their looking to mod. That is the reality you do not want to accept. Ever heard of the term: "It's the thought that counts", there's a reason it exists.

Or perhaps not, maybe that's just your character, and if so, Geez. Good luck to you and your endeavors.
By the way, @05SpeedMaster
I don't need your motivation at all, nor did I so much as mention that in any way in my original post, I don't know you; and with that attitude, who would even want your help? Or so much as want to work with you? I can't imagine.

No, that is not what we have seen in 20 years. Of course, there are many that do thank for a certain tool or for help they got. However, we have seen as many people taking stuff posted here and use elsewhere, pretending they did it themselves. No thanks, no credits to the original author. I would say it is very naive to think people "thank silently" (that is the same as not thanking at all, since to thank someone, you need to make them aware) or that people will credit the authors. We've seen users come here begging to be helped, then pop up on another forum showing off the help of others as if their own.

> This is part of the reason I avoided Xentax and used Zenhax. I haven't forgotten about Xentax entirely but this reason here kinda reminds me of why I stayed away. Games are specificâ€”not all the same; sure some general points may be transferable but games have different structures, don't use the same engine, some are console, PC, different architectures, and its always better to work with another to better learnâ€”paying for that time given.

Just what is part of the reason you you avoided XeNTaX? You speak in vague terms and are not specific. The fact that we do not allow paid work? The fact that we do not expect experts to hand-hold people to learn something very complex, since the experts do all this for fun and free? This site has 163484 posts in ~20000 topics. There is a lot of explaining that is happening in those posts, a lot of tools, and a lot of back-and-forth, not to mention the tutorials section. But we doubled down on people that want a quick-fix so they can shine somewhere else, even paid ones, since we have seen they basically claim stuff as their own somewhere else. We expect people to at least try, when coming with a request. 

The forum rules prohibiting posting and linking to copyrighted materials are part of what primed aluigi to leave XeNTaX and start Zenhax at the end of 2014. Of note, he joined XeNTaX in December 2005. Also, aluigi and I have no issues, we have worked pleasantly here for many years, and settled any differences we may have had at the time he forked off with his own copy-cat forum. He is an awesome programmer and reverse engineer, genuine stand up guy. Did you know he based QuickBMS on my MultiEx Commander's MexScript? BMS actually stands for Binary MultiEx Script, which is a compiled form of MexScript. You can read that here: [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/quickbms.txt](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/quickbms.txt)
Regarding those rules, if you haven't seen them: [viewtopic.php?t=1270](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=1270)
For each of those rules there are clear reasons we implemented them along the way.

So what you are saying is that the behaviour of others at this forum has demotivated you to start learning yourself? Honestly? You are putting blame for your lack of motivation on some knowledgable people with egos? Motivation for this sort of thing comes from within. You either want it or not. There are many other places to go than XeNTaX, this forum is just one of many platforms. And a niche at that. It's like saying you were not motivated to study well at math in school, because this one boy or girl in your class was excellent at it, but refused to teach you. How do you motivate yourself for anything in life? I think your statement is false.

Please stop right there. Why are you being so toxic? This is exactly why people prefer to keep things private and focus on their own interests. There aren't many websites like this, so let's not deceive ourselves. If you're feeling frustrated, it would be better to go elsewhere and avoid bothering people here. Engaging in this behavior serves no purpose. Just leave and stop causing unnecessary negativity. Keep your toxic opinions to yourself. Yes, this is a discussion forum, but people here are trying to help each other. Your posts are unhelpful and harmful by any means.

Then why are you here, just commenting how toxic XeNTaX is. You are just trolling at this point. And you are off the mark by miles, looking at your 8 posts here (mostly in this thread), you never actually participated on this site. So just leave if you don't like it here and know you are not a reference for any of us.

Xentax is a forum, it hosts threads which are indexed by search engines. If there is not a lot of posts per hour, it does not matter that the site is not being used. Whenever I want to extract something from some game, Xentax is always a place that helps me out with a topic already made by somebody where I can find discussion and tools. 
When it's gone, all the data will be gone as well, all the tools, all the years worth of topics, and no place for any new ones. Loss of info would be immense. 
Please, I am sick and tired of this trend when every old website suddenly decided to die in the last couple of years. What would even be left of the internet in the future?
Just set up a crypto wallet for donations, set up paypal, as much options as you can. The more options you are able to give, the more people would donate for the website's upkeep. PayPal is not available in some countries for example, but some people can't bother with crypto, the more options to pay you will provide, the most likely somebody is going to do it. Set up a donation link somewhere people can actually see it too.

Just set up a crypto wallet for donations, set up paypal, as much options as you can. The more options you are able to give, the more people would donate for the website's upkeep. PayPal is not available in some countries for example, but some people can't bother with crypto, the more options to pay you will provide, the most likely somebody is going to do it. Set up a donation link somewhere people can actually see it too.

To restate, current funding is not the biggest issue, unless we wish to expand the site and offer dedicated downloads, for example. What I need is people with time. I need people to manage the site,  a true webmaster, that keeps everything up to date and runs the show. Preferably just taking over the whole site. Since I have 0 time to manage it, moderate it, keep it up to date and deal with all the external bullshit.

To be fair, this thread was not "We need staff" or "Xentax needs a new owner." This thread was 1) "we wish the site to continue" and 2) the very first thing you said in your first post was "we have no funding" and then you continued to focus on money with further comments such as "Nothing is for free in the end."

People have to read through a lot of this thread to find out what you actually want, which is people to take over the site?

I think that people have overwhelmingly answered both of the main points of this thread as per the thread title and the original post, 1) people want the site to continue and 2) people are willing to provide funding.

So what's the next step?

I sent you a PM over a week ago but maybe I'm doing something wrong, it's sitting in my "Outbox" and won't move to "Sent messages," I'm not sure if it only moves to "Sent" once you read it?

To be fair, the subtitle of the poll is: "We wish the site to continue, so we support it." 
Support can be anything, of course, not money alone. As long as it helps the site. 

I get that people wish the site to continue. But then the next step would be to support it, one way or the other.

You can ask for volunteers to apply for moderation positions, I am sure plenty of people would be interested. Administration role could be handed over to a willing member of the current mod team who is a veteran of his role. If worst come to worst, you can always hire a moderation team, if money is the issue, you can ask people to donate.
There are so many things that could be done to make the situation better, there is no need to close the website. I noticed that a lot of admins go "well, that's it, there is no choice, I am closing it down", without trying to do even the minimal effort to keep it going. I understand that you don't have free time, but this is exactly why you should ask website's community for help.
I and a lot of other people value the wealth of niche knowledge that this website amassed during the years and continue to gather still.

Dunno if it's been suggested, but I think a Patreon/Subscribestar would be a good option for a site like this. People can't be bothered to be manually donating regularly. It's a lot easier to just sub $2-10 or w/e to support a place and then not have to pay attention.

The site could use some extra promotion too, I'm not sure a lot of new people easily find this place, it's a lot of the "old guard".

When I read this. I thought you are want innovative which this site. Current state of this site may make you lost interesting. Because it's aged and need evolution. This forum is pretty look old for me, which if can turn to latest technical as using another framework as Discourse because function effectively and update very often instead of phpBB or vBulletin, etc. And that reason why Discord, Telegram Group is taking place of traditional forums

I belive this forum is famous with everyone who do reverse engine and modder. And a lot of talents here as daemon1, chrrox, etc... But because of limited of old framework that doesn't let people active much. Also heavy obsolete that costly too much for maintain 

I'll try to give you some encourage, remake this, change to another effective platform, integrate AI for managing task, have a appeal and friendly UI, etc. But that absolutely taking time and will become punishment if you don't have passion in it. But the reward is this reborn place become mostly grown community for reversing engine.

But if you are not interesting in this anymore, you don't need to ask us. Because you are own this place not community, just let it die and move on. In case, you still want it continue to live then just let community own it like open source where everyone can contribute and maintain it.

TL;DR: Find your inspiration. If you can find you will found a way, then this is resolve. If not just let it go and farewell. Don't need to fighting with it.

Honestly I found out about XeNTaX recently (I'm 18 anyway I haven't lived long enough to discover many things   ) and I found it really cool and informative even if nobody helped me except ikskoks (thanks ikskoks   ) . I completely agree with what some said , this forum needs a complete overhaul to attract more audience. The modding community is getting bigger everyday and they need forums like this with huge information and data to read and learn from. Though, I voted not to wish the site to continue because honestly I can't support it  I'm broke   all I can contribute with is 5$ to 10$ max (as one 1$ = 3.75 in my currency) and I would really like it if it was through Patreon. Thanks Mr.Mouse and everyone contributing to this site.

Dear friend Mr. Mouse,

As an experienced forum owner, I have the skills required to effectively manage and improve a large community forum. Unfortunately, my current schedule is quite packed. However, if you are unable to find another suitable candidate, I am prepared to take on the responsibility and carry out a thorough overhaul, potentially transitioning away from PHPBB. Additionally, I am capable of facilitating the migration to my own server farms and managing the domain transfer process. Please consider this offer as a last resort, as I am currently occupied with other commitments. However, if this forum is at risk of fading away, I would prefer to step in and assist, if other mods would still willing help to moderate it..

Well, I do not have much posts, but Xentax is one of the first places I go to when I have troubles (granted, I do not have those often).

Even though I've pressed that I will support Xentax, I cannot give no money. First, I'm next to dirt poor. Second, I'm from Russia so PayPal banned me and bypassing the ban costs even more money, which I do not have as of now.

For what it takes, I've mentioned Xentax on my YouTube channel every time I've received help here... or found it here. Because aside from my posts, I've actually simply found already prepared solutions on these forums on several ocassions.

Still, I guess that would be like, what, a dozen times at best? Plus my channel only has 800 not very active subs, so go figure...

And yet, here I am again, made another post asking for help one more time. Every time I visit Xentax, I feel like this here is a community, and even though I myself is rare, unexperienced and rather useless guest, Xentax is always on my mind since I've discovered it back in 2019.

Would be really sad to see yet another good site go.

I don't know if this will add anything or if anyone will notice[as usual] but most of my posts and many others I've seen usually have no responses. I don't want the site to go but I would come to the site to see if there's more activity but it's usually someone asking a question and no one responding.

Being that people only look at things that interest them? Maybe most of your posts don't interest people.
I don't look at anything that don't interest me. No SpongeBob, anything Android, anything Play Station, nor obscure Chinese stuff.
Best I can say is LEARN to Do it yourself. 
Seems to many expect INSTANT GRATIFICATION and then whine they don't get it.

Where is a Donate button?

However, I think there is an implicit problem with sites like Xentax: people usually post here looking for help, but only a few users regularly read the forum to help others.

I'm not a everyday user of this forum biut I sometime come here for tools, methods and new techniques. And I don't know any other places or forums where I can find something. I'm bad to use Discord, I'm oldschool user.
This will be so sad to lost place like this

I don't ever post, but this forum has been a goldmine of information and learning. If it shuts down, all I ask is for a backup to be made available. The information here is invaluable. Appreciate all the work everyone has done over the years. I went from knowing nothing about extracting/reverse engineering games, to being able to extract models from hexcode and figuring out how to reverse game archives.

I registered mainly to post in this topic. I find this site to be awesome and would love for it to continue. I also agree that if it doesn't an archived copy would be needed. I was a hardcore user of TheISOZone way in the past (its formatting was actually pretty similar to this site), and lost tons of information, interactions, etc when it suddenly vanished, so I would hate for that to happen again to the regulars here. However, whether it continues or not, I would very much like to thank the admin @Mr.Mouse for everything he has done so far. Huge respect.

I will also speak out: you know what the problem is with many romhacker forums with useful information for hacking/translating games and utilities for this? They are no more. Even in the webarchive: as a rule, forums have their own complex URL, which the webarchive does not back up. So a LOT of information was lost on the Internet from the forums of the late 90s - early 2000s - the time when the topic of romhacking PS1, DC, PS2, PC, etc. was very relevant and information could be obtained first hand. And now these sites simply do not exist.    I wouldn't want Xentax to suffer the same fate. In the end, you can try to move to a cheaper server.

The Xentax forum is years and years of communication, discussion, research and useful attachments. It would be a pity if so much of this information was lost. In addition to usefulness, it's also a story. From time to time I take on the next game, I encounter new formats there and, as a rule, I donâ€™t know how to open them and how to work with them. And this information is usually already in one quantity or another on the forum, I just havenâ€™t gotten to it yet. It would be a shame to know that it disappeared at the very moment when you needed it.

In general, if suddenly the site decides to close, I would REALLY like to have a backup copy of the site (preferably offline browsable), uploaded somewhere on a Drop Box or other cloud.

Hello   , I recently made an account just so I can post on this topic.  I had only found this forum in the last couple of days but a lot of the topics seem interesting to me.  I often surf the web to find things like this but I find this forum interesting.  I have been interested in the fighting game engine MUGEN and modding for The Simpsons Hit & Run.  I would much like to peruse this forum for a bit longer.  I'm willing to donate a few dollars if that's what it takes to keep the servers running.

What is necessary to keep the site alive?
I guess a webmaster (technical admin) who takes care of the hosting, technical issues, keeping the software up-to-date etc.
Then a couple of moderators. And of course money to pay the bills (how much is it per year?)

It would be great, if we had some job descriptions including the tasks, responsibilites and estimated hours of work.
Otherwise it's hard to find anyone who is willing to commit to the job.

So I think at least three people now (including myself) have offered to take over the site, since it seems thatâ€™s what Mr. Mouse wanted. Perhaps others have also privately offered assistance in various ways. At this point I think a pretty good variety of opinions have been shared, with many similar comments among them. Itâ€™s up to Mr. Mouse what he wants to do next.
