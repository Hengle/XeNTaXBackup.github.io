Hello there!

There is a way to extract 3d models from this game? It uses .dk4 files and the tools that actually open them are not accesible anymore  
If someone can help me pls

edit: ok, then someone will have to do the hard work getting proper face indices...

Here's a poor try, chassis of  bike (point cloud) on the left:

Created fake FIs look weird. The existing FIs have annoying skips
like so
...
f 687 686 692 
f 701 702 703 
f 704 705 703 
f 705 701 703 
f 706 707 708 
f 709 707 710 
f 710 707 706 
-----------
f 1297 1298 711 
f 712 1299 1300 
f 711 709 1301 
...

Seems thus you can't care for single sub meshes (12?) but have to handle the beast in a whole.

Too many weird faces. I have no idea, why:
edit: it's because you dumbo shouldn't have used strips

Depends on - there's people who usually have more luck with FIs than me.  

Plus, there's an onbike sample where fake face indices work better. thus one could compare to the original ones (maybe):

Here is how to read the file
And also what it looks like

I wasn't sure of that 20 bytes triangles' block, especially the 3 floats. Need to check them... seems it's normals.

btw: was is "pad" good for? (Always zero?)

Ok, someone can explain to me what it serves?
I mean
Is a code for...?   
I am a noob on research  

...

However, this can be useful? (but this is anotehr motorbike)

If someone can help me pls

Can you tell me how did you extracted the files from the .dkz archive files?
