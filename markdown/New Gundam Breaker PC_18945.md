[https://www.mediafire.com/file/76w5dif3 ... s.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/76w5dif32w5jb11/new_gundam_breaker_sounds.zip/file)

wondering if anyone would be able to have a way to convert these to a usable format, i tried asking gildor to support NGB since its on unreal 4 but he had a tantrum over how bad it looked(it is bad though) but its the only good place to find gundam related sounds from right now
