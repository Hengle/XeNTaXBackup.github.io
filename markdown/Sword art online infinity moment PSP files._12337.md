- Post Title: Sword art online infinity moment PSP files.

Okay so I have been doing research on this for about 8 or 9 hours now, and all of my searching has come up with is badly written explanations or people being smug and giving so little information it is not helpful at all. I am trying to get at the 3d models with in this game for my own personal projects and such, there is a "tutorial" and I say that very loosly for the subject at this link here [http://wiki.vg-resource.com/wiki/Sword_ ... ity_Moment](http://wiki.vg-resource.com/wiki/Sword_Art_Online:_Infinity_Moment)
It gives so little information it hurts, I tried every single version of JPCSP out there and none of them can save the decrypted PGD file all of them only save the old un decrypted one ...I have the quick BMS script to get at the files once the PGD is decrypted but alas I can't even get to that. I am stuck on this one step because of bad information and its killing me. 
Can any one makes sens of that so called "tutorial" in the link.

I have several times, it just doesn't show up in noesis unfortunately. and the file is small. the PGD is only 888 kb, I really don't think thats big enough for a model let alone all the games model and texture files? I think the model files are in the install.dat, and I don't know how to open that, but it gives me this error when I try to extract it Output extension has set output file type to:
*.* - Unknown
File is too massive (1.02 GB), and is not handled as a stream.

Okay scratch that the PGD file is 880 000 kb ... thats more than enough to be all the models and everything else the whole game is only 1.3 gb. so I just need to decrypt the PGD file.

The problem is, all of the JPCSP emulator don't extract the decrypted file like everyone says, it only pops out the old undecrypted file. and the Quick BMS script won't work on that.

Okay so I figured it out. the install.dat, its a CPK file apparently, and i need to decode it, but I have no idea how, since none of the CPK things I have work on it.  and quick BMS wont work on it either. just says it's not UTF encoded.
