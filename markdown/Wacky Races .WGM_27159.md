- Post Title: Wacky Races .WGM

Hi, I am trying to open the .WGM files of this game, because I fixed the aspect ratio, but to do that the fog increased and I wanted to see if there was something inside these files to disable it, can you help me to open this kind of files?

I often use FileViewPro to open .WGM files. I think that you can try this software.

I tried to download it but the program says I can't open this type of file in the demo version. Could you try to open the uploaded file? In case the program works, can I upload the other files?
