- Post Title: [PS2] Xenosaga .SS2 audio ADPCM problem

Hey guys, I need some help in the game Xenosaga Ep 01. I used PSS Plex to demux .pss videos (m2v + wav) and multiplex function + ADPCM (compress sound ACPCM) to create a new PSS.
When I use the new PSS video and insert the game, the audio does not work well. I'm using PCSX2 1.0 and the original videos with audio are perfect in this emulator. The same happens when I use PS2STR to create PSS files.
When i checking the original audio file .SS2 it have the interleave 400 bytes, when converted (ss2 -> wav -> ss2), the audio gets interleave 20 bytes using the PSS Plex. How to fix this limitation of PSS Plex?
I tried to create a pss video in PS2STR without converting the audio (original .ss2 extracted using VGMToolbox or MFAudio 1.1), and when a PSS is created and inserted into the game, the same happens even having interleave 400 bytes.
I upload the pss video (prologue original and prologue converting PSS Plex and PS2STR) for analysis. If someone can help, I am very grateful, because I'll do the insert of all videos in the game and need the perfect audio.
