- Post Title: Crash Twinsanity

Hi! I have quite a long time studying Crash Twinsanity, during this time was able to deal with models, sounds and textures (partly). Now turn and sounds inside archives. Digging in the files, I was able to extract the audio, but I do not understand what this format, it even does not have a header ! Sound plays perfectly in PSsound, but I need to understand what kind of format is. Please help advice. Thank you!
