- Post Title: Repacking files to *_info.psb.m and *_body.bin

I'm trying to see if I can work on the translation of a game called Kenka Bancho Otome for the Vita. 

The game files that I'm trying to modify are on [scenario_info.psb.m](https://goo.gl/1axWzu) and [scenario_body.bin](https://goo.gl/7DEsaa) which I was able to extract using [exm2lib](http://asmodean.reverse.net/pages/exm2lib.html). 

The extracted files are encrypted like [this](https://goo.gl/oWBfZ6) and [this](https://goo.gl/37PCWC) but I was able to use another tool to decrypt and edit the game text files. 

However, my problem now is that I have no means to repack the modified files back to the *_info.psb.m and *_body.bin since the asmodean tool can only extract it.

Any help on this is appreciated.

I'm also looking for a method to extract/rebuild this files.
Today the Nintendo Switch Version came out and I've extracted some of its files.

Would be cool if you could help me out with this!
