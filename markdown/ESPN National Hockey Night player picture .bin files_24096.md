- Post Title: ESPN National Hockey Night player picture .bin files

I tried using PCSX2 to dump the player portrait textures from the game, but the textures wind up having multiple portraits in one texture. I was wondering how to open the .bin files that contain them, but I am not sure how to do that. If anyone can help me, I'd gladly appreciate it.

You can preview image in texture finder

Also, it seems that signature for this file is "MWo3"
which also occurs in BIN files from other games.

Thanks, but it seemingly combines images together- both in the preview and on my computer. Instead of Maxim Afinogenov and Kevyn Adams, we have Maxim Adams, as an example.
