Read this forum more thoroughly to find that it is a false positive.

These are AUTOMATED detection algorithms that always have a lot of false positives. You should really REALLY read up on current events before accusing us of having infected software.

Absolutely it is a false positive. I did an experiment in which I used the same anti-virus software that detects MultiEX setup. I submitted this issue to my tentative anti-virus lab and they just found out that it is a false positive.
