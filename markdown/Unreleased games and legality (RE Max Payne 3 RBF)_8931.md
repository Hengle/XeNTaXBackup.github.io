- Post Title: Unreleased games and legality (RE: Max Payne 3 RBF)

Mr.Mouse recently locked a thread about Max Payne 3, because the game wasn't released yet, however I do have certain questions and I believe they should be stated publically.

1. What about games that are preloaded on Steam, several days, sometimes two weeks before the release date? You get the files to toy around with even if you can't run the game yet -- and you get said files legally -- so why not discuss these?

2. What about games that have public, or semi-public beta tests with normally downloadable beta clients -- are they also off the chart?

michalss was wrong on many levels -- about scene groups' sources for games, which often are in the companies themselves, only that their bosses don't know it, and most importantly about the availability of Max Payne 3 PC -- which is, by what I saw, unavailable on warez sites, at least in PC flavor which I've noticed was one of the versions discussed there. True, X360 version was warezzed out already, but the only source for PC files I can possibly think of is Steam preload (as the game is coming to steam pretty soon).

EDIT: I just looked into the screenshots and saw that they show files from the X360 build of MP3 so obviously there are no PC files discussed, so albeit the MP3-specific question flies out the window, the remaining ones still remain:

- what about Steam preloads and official (non-leaked) betas?

Steam preloads come fully encrypted (a majority of the time, can't think of any time this wasn't the case).

Max Payne 3 is not out. Its release date is the 15th (console), regardless if you can obtain the game legally beforehand.

Yeah, but sometimes encrypted are only executables (or they ain't delivered even -- had one such case where I had files lying around for five days without an exe) and the rest of the files are already in place. Granted, encrypted files would be a legal issue, but it's not always like this.

almost all betas that are not open beta have a nda agreement you agreed to when you play the game.
so it would need to be an entirely open beta in which case you can point to the page for people to sign up and then they can get the client on their own.

also i am sure if you read the steam tos doing anything witht he files in the first place is not allowed.

Steam preloads are always fully encrypted. every file. atleast every preload i've ever been in was that way. l4d2 had every file, sniper elite v2 same, can't think but i know i've been in quite a few. even the first preload they did, hl2, was fully encrypted. I don't know of any other preloading download services, but i'd bet they'd do the same full encryption like steam. also, there isn't a preload for max payne 3 yet, i think. these files, regardless of your personal preorder status, are illegal. they are dumped from a disk you do not possess. just because you've preordered a similar disc doesn't give you the right to steal it's contents in advance. also, steamworks disc games are also fully encrypted and lacking exe's if that's what you're talking about? but it's not just the exe's missing, the key for game decryption isnt available until steam puts them up.
