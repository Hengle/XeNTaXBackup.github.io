- Post Title: [PS2] Xenosaga 01 Translation project (need help Menu01.xtx)

Hello guys, I created a translation project in Brazilian Portuguese
[http://romhacking.trd.br/index.php?/top ... ndub-dvd9/](http://romhacking.trd.br/index.php?/topic/10171-ps2-tradu%C3%A7%C3%A3o-xenosaga-epis%C3%B3dio-i-der-wille-zur-macht-undub-dvd9/)
and I need help to modify the menu01.xtx file that contains the font of the menus and stuff.


That's the best I could see that file.

I am not aware of this type file. If anyone has this knowledge and want to help, I appreciate it.
