repacking any file is a different problem from unpacking. how about providing more details on the blur unpacker? if you have the source or could explain the format you might be helping others instead of just requesting stuff.

No need to repackage the file. Game read files from the extracted folder. Delete or rename the original file.

Works, but with proper directory structure, the same inside the pak file. So will not have problem with character limit.
