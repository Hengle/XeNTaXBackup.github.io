any way to extract from it or at least decompress it?

Also, I was looking through a savestate for the game i created, and i found out that this game uses a library caled the "Shade game Library" created by it's developer Shade, inc, The people behind Koei's Mystic Heroes, and Activision's Orphen: Scion by Sorcery. I think this game uses ShdLib. Mind taking a look at this.
