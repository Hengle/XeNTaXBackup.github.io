- Post Title: HITMAN 2 fonts edit

Hi guys
I want to localize HITMAN 2 (Steam) to Korean and I want to know how to edit font in .gfx 
I found all fonts and subtitles and succeeded in changing the letters in the subtitles BUT all the Korean letters are in error.
Like this(black boxes in front of 47 are Korean):


So I found the font in the GFXF format file and embedded the Korean font in the Chinese font file by using JPEXS decompiler.


But this time all the letters in error.
Like this:


What did I do wrong? I would be very much obliged if someone would help me.
