- Post Title: The Neverhood .nhi textures (type B)

Trying to fix some issues with my native localisation of The Neverhood (PC), I've found BLB-repacker in github, it splited I.blb to separated .nhi files. Type A - 8bit bmp with uncompressed image data, freely openable via tilemolester. But I need to decompress font-file and change it, repacking again. It is in Type B - .nhi-files.
The first 6 bytes are the header, next 1024 - pallete. And then there's some encrypted image data, that I can't decompress. I've tried rle, but it gave me back a pure junk. So, anyone, could you please help me with (un)compressing bmp or png to such a file? The examples are in attached files. The second one is the result unpacked by ([https://github.com/michal4132/pyBLB](https://github.com/michal4132/pyBLB)), but it couldn't compress it into .nhi back.

You have to share public links to the GD, because we don't have access to the samples.

Now that should work, sorry. Completely forgot 'bout that.
