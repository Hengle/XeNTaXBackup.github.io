- Post Title: Rip models from PS2 BIN files?

Hello. I am very interested in the models of the game Wild Arms 3, and I am certain that the enemies' models are inside the file BTLMON.BIN. There are bosses I am interested in having models of, and my favorite character that is possibly in the file is Janus Cascade, as well as Siegfried. Can I please have help?
