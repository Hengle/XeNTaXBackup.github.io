Hello community,

Racing Lagoon is a game by Square. It has amazing low poly car models, but I don't know if there is a tool to open the game archives.

[http://www.solidfiles.com/d/46d485e21f/CAR.BIN](http://www.solidfiles.com/d/46d485e21f/CAR.BIN)

Two more archives (headers seem different):

[http://www.solidfiles.com/d/b75f045251/SYSTEM.BIN](http://www.solidfiles.com/d/b75f045251/SYSTEM.BIN)


It will be greatly appreciated if someone can take a look! Thanks.

Sorry that people here on XeNTaX aren't your personal slaves. Calling people "manchildren" isn't going to get you much help either.

Go find another site if you hate it here so much.

Looks like these .BIN files have a corresponding header file that gives offsets/sizes for the data inside the .BIN files. Kinda like FAT/DAT files I guess.

That forum topic was sarcasm and despite everything pointing in that direction you think it is real.
Even if it was real, it doesn't matter. You should respect people and let me tell you that attitude won't get you far in life.
You work on cars? Do I need a mechanic right now? Who cares? Did anyone ask?

Nothing you say holds any substance whatosever, don't know why you even bother. Perhaps you should do the old toaster in the bathtub trick and end it all, nerd? Oh sorry, I mean "ner0", this sad kid with his wack ass "leet hacker" name hahahahaha.

I advise people reading not to click the link above.
It redirects to

Anyway, a mod or an admin would be nice right now.

Wow, he knows about some tough guy copy-pasta from 2007, yet he doesn't know to not click shady links. Real smart.
