- Post Title: [WIKI] Merging categories "PC formats" and "Platform PC"

I was looking around the wiki to see if there was anything I could help out with, and I noticed that there are two similar-sounding categories:

[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title= ... PC_formats](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Category:PC_formats)
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title= ... latform_PC](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Category:Platform_PC)

As far as I can tell, they server exactly the same purpose. I wanted to get some feedback from people before I start merging the two together.
