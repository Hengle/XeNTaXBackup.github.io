I have been waiting for someone to upload texture for them. 

UFC Undisputed 2010 scripts only work for the actual model, but I can not get the textures no matter what I do,

Sorry to bump an old topic but I just saw this now. 

The model format is very close to the wwe format and is almost readable in X-Rey. The textures seem to be swizzled. Does anyone have a few models from the ps3 version for test so that I can confirm?
