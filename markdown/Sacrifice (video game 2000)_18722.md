- Post Title: Sacrifice (video game 2000)

Hello!! I'm Mariana and I have a question about the game called Sacrifice.
Is there a way to fix Charlotte's taunts in multiplayer? She's third and fourth taunts are replaced by Yogo's voice!

Multiplayer Taunts:
1-You filthy git!
2-Oh, this is gonna hurt you more than me!
"Due to a mistake on the developer's part, the other two taunts are actually Yogo's taunts, with her voices remaining unused."

Charlotte's unused taunt must be this  3-What's the matter, afraid of spiders? and 4-Yeomens Follow me.

Oh please give me a hand, I'm new here. Thanks to all.

You cannot import/replace Sacrifice files on WAD ones so it's impossible.
