- Post Title: TRE Archiver Requires Registration (but is registered)

Hello,

I have just recently become a friend of MultiEx. I've enjoyed use of the TRE Archiver program but have a minor issue. I've registered MultiEx but the TRE Archiver seems to not believe me and will not allow me to extract ([Open]) from TOC files. It tells me, "This feature requires registration of MultiEx Commander."

Screenshot of the error.

It seems another user, golfrguy, had the same issue, but I couldn't find any hint through much searching on how he might have solved it.

I am using the most recent versions of both pieces of software.
MultiEx Commander 4.3.1
XeNTaX' TRE Archiver 1.03 (1.0.3)

I read that MultiEx version 4.2.0 worked with the TRE Archiver, but the post by Mr.Mouse was from Feb 2006, some time ago and I don't know how outdated the info may be.

I can't find a copy of 4.2.0 anywhere in my searching. If that is the issue, where can I get a copy, and will my registration code work with it? If not please suggest whatever I can do to solve this. I would be indebted for the help.

Thank you,
Paul

As I recall, TRE Archiver required frequent updates in the past (though that probably has to do with the format(s) it covers, and not MexCom). It's possible that something was changed between MexCom 4.2 and 4.3 that's causing this, but I don't have any idea what it might be.

Dinoguy is right. This has to do with something that has changed between the two versions of MexCom. I'll see if I can dig up the code to the TRE Archiver and then update the program.
