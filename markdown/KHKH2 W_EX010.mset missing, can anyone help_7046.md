- Post Title: KH/KH2 W_EX010.mset missing, can anyone help?

i was recently going over some KH2 models and it seems that the file W_EX010.mset was not extracted from the game, so i was wondering if anyone had a copy of the file they can send to me so i can look at how square and disney set their character riggs up.

please reply to this ASAP, as this would really be appreciated.

ive also noticed that W_EX010_RX.mset isnt being extracted with KH2Dump either, please if anyone can help me out here itll make my day.

I think so you talking about KH2 "Final Mix+".
I couldn't  find "W_EX010_RX.mset" at nametbl.txt.  
If you don't mind my saying so,Do not you misunderstand it with the file of other names?

i did, turns out the model viewer wasnt wrong, when i was dumping i could manually input filenames fo example id type "obj/W_EX010_RX.mset" hit enter, and it would search and dump that file from the game disc, but ill still look into your model viewer, the one im using's app name reads as "khkh_xldM ]["
