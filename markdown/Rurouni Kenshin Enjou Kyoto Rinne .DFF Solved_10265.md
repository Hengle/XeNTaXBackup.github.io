- Post Title: Rurouni Kenshin Enjou Kyoto Rinne .DFF >Solved

Hi, I'm trying to extract models from Rurouni Kenshin Enjou Kyoto Rinne. This game uses the .DFF format as discovered here.
[viewtopic.php?f=16&p=50878](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&p=50878)

I've extracted a bunch of .RAW files from the DATA.AFS. And with Fate Unlimited Codes and Battle Stadium D.O.N I only had to extract the DATA.AFS which gave me .RAW files. Then change the .RAW to .FPK and extract them with Noesis to get .DFF files. However I can't get Noesis to extract the .FPK files from this game. So it seems that the .RAW files aren't the same.

I've attached a .RAW file to this post so someone can look at it for me.

Thanks for any help.  

EDIT:
I figured out how to get the models, so I will explain so others can know what to do.
1. Extract the DATA.AFS from the game.
2. Open Noesis and extract all of the files from DATA.AFS.
3. Add the .fpk extension to the files that don't have an extension, such as 0000_ch.
4. Open the .fpk in Noesis and extract the .fpk.
5. Now you will see the .DFF files so you can open them in 3DS Max.
