- Post Title: Split\Second Translation

Hello!

I'm currently trying to open an ark file, which includes the text from Split\Second. I want to translate the game to my language, but I need your help for that. I mean, for opening the file. Somehow some russian dudes translated it. From the downloaded "russian patch" I understood that the file is resident.ark (around 800 MB), but the patch was simply around 2-3 MB. Even the installator somehow "opened" this file and pasted the russian localization in it. Okay, I can't give you a sample of this file, but I can give you other, still with .ark extension. 

DOWNLOAD FROM 4shared | DOWNLOAD FROM MediaFire

I want to know is there a way to open it (I'm sure there is), it looks to me just as some kind of an archive.

Sorry for my poor english, as you can see, I want to translate it to my language, which means I'm not from UK or USA.

Use this script:

The texts of the game are in the .dic files, but I did not know how to edit them. I can only say they are records of a SQL DB.
If someone discovers how to edit them, please post a tool or method of how to do it.

If you get your hands on some .dic files post them to let us have a look.

I opened them with Notepad and there is a plain text inside them, but at the beginning there are some weird symbols that I don' understand. 
Hopefully, there will be a tool for these files.

Sorry for my poor english.

The Problem isn't with unpacking/packing these .dic files, but with importing edited files back into .ark archive

Yeah, that is also a problem. Too bad that the russian dudes don't answer my PMs. 
I asked them about everything, but they don't tell. They packed back the files with installator! Can you imagine that?

Jurko
This file has the same file structure of the game Turok that you analyzed, but not all were consistent with the hash of the log of the same compiler.
If you could analyze it again, I would be grateful, I can send you the build logs from the game files. Discovering the file structure of Turok, we have the answer for this game.

Ok, i maybe know how to import files back, but I don't know how to decrypt and encrypt unpacked files. I need some tools for it

it's very complicated. I unpack and pack files manually. If someone want unpacked text and font files write me to pm and I send you files to translate and then you send me files back to compile

Request a template in English would be asking too much?  
And how did you calculate the hash of edited strings?
