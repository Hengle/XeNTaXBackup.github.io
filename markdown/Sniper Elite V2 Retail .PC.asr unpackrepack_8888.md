I'm checking the files and seems the only problem is with the identification of the endianess.
I'm trying to find an universal way to recognize the endianess of the Asura files

There's a lot of files inside the "Common.asr" with no extensions (I can't read them)

Is it be cause they still encrypted or compressed ?

Asura works great in my tests. 
In this particular case the error appears with the file MP.pc_textures that has zero bytes.
I selected the file MP.pc (6Mb) only instead of the 3 files that are in the folder, as u can see:




¡¡¡¡Thanks aluigi!!!!
Could you tell me please how to "repack" this 587 files into (new) MP.pc file?

with these files the situation is a bit boring because the uncompressed archives (no AsuraCmp and no AsuraZlb) are valid for the rebuilding without problems.

instead for the AsuraCmp/Zlb archive you should first unpack them and then you can replace them with the unpacked archive.

luckily doing that is very easy because when asura.bms finds a Cmp/Zlb archive it gets unpacked as temporary file and it doesn't get deleted till you confirms its deletion from quickbms at the end of the process.

so if you have one of these archives (easy to know because quickbms will ask you to delete a temporary file) try to:
- answer N when quickbms asks you to delete the temporary file
- go in your temp folder (%temp%) and copy the temporary_file file over the original asura archive you extracted before (do a backup copy first)
- now run the game to be sure that it loads the unpacked archive
- if it works you can use quickbms in reimport mode with the new archive

Thanks aluigi!!!

Following your instructions... I did it!   




BUT...  

My goal is just to mute the sounds of the heart beating' character... so I edited that uncompressed wav files and saved them with the same parameters (channles, bit depth, etc). The resulting file were a little smaller (42Kb) than the original ones (44.9Kb)... so its ok.......... and I was able to "rebuild" the original gmsnd.asr file.-
I runned the game (Sniper Elite v2) for test BUT all the sounds from gmsnd.asr file disappeared!!   

Any ideas?

PS: why Quickbms tells me "6 files reimported" if I just have 5 files edited?

Thanks for your time.

Delutto, I used your unpacker/packer and works fine. But if is text longer than original, file is not working correctly.
Disabled audio and text. Any idea? Thanks for reply.

Hi guys!

Some months ago I tried to translate the SEV2 game. None of the programs which I found here or on the internet, didn't work properly, so I wrote it for own.
I couldn't publish until now, because they were written in php (I'm not too good in other languages on pc). Now I found a possibility to convert it to a single exe, and it's not needed install apache and php longer.
The SEV2 asr translator treats the NZA asr files too.
Translators usage:
The texts are contained in .asr and .en files, and you have to put these files to the /Data directory.
The texts are contained in unicode, or unicod-like syntax. It means the characters have two bytes and the second byte in most cases zero.
If you see red "Warning!" notice, the next text contains some special characters, which second byte is/are not zero. After the edit, on the second byte you have to write back the original value in a hex editor.
