- Post Title: Hexx - Heresy of the wizard .PAC file

Can somebody take a look at this file? When i view it in HxD, there are creative voice files (.VOC)
i have tried using a ripping program to extract them but they seem to be corrupted. Opening the file as
.RAW in a sound editor is just a garbled mess. I have attached a sample and also a comparison file
from another game which uses the same engine with the same extensions but the .VOC's inside
it can be extracted.
