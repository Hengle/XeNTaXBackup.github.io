- Post Title: Need help about GundamOnline hed/dat

hello everyone,i know it is a old topic about gundamonline .hed and dat,but i could't find some useful infomations about these files.

sample:[https://github.com/pgw00k/unity3d-file/ ... ed_Dat.zip](https://github.com/pgw00k/unity3d-file/releases/download/1.2/GundamOnline_Hed_Dat.zip)

sample2:[https://github.com/pgw00k/unity3d-file/ ... _Dat_2.zip](https://github.com/pgw00k/unity3d-file/releases/download/1.2/GundamOnline_Hed_Dat_2.zip)

1. i found zlib1.dll on the game root,maybe it use zlib compress,but i couldn't identify it.

2. .hed file header 8 bytes it looks similer.

thanks!
