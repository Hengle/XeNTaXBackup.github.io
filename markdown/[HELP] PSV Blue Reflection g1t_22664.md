- Post Title: [HELP] PSV Blue Reflection g1t

i've been trying to manually replacing some texture using several sw available on the net.

Replace one texture (clothes texture) with another using import *.png format.
( Confirmed that kukkii can replace and swizzled image back into *.g1t )
checked *.dds files inside "repacked" *.g1t manually

Problem with Kukkii :

"Replaced" texture (*.dds) is missing 1 mipmap layer,
Repacked *.g1t got some broken value, can't be load into PSV
i try to unpack "repacked" *.g1t using "gust_g1t" and get this error :
Assertion failed: expected_size >= texture_size + (unint32_t)size_of(g1t_tex_header)

I extract back "modded" *.dds from *.g1t using switch_toolbox, then check it manually on the file comparing with the original one.
i've conclusion :

1st and 2nd mipmap layer actually have different swizzle pattern (kukkii only re-create 1 mipmap layer)
1st layer swizzled by kukkii is correctly same as the original swizzled image.
then i try to manually create dds using directx tex tool, i can't find any other sw that have ability to generate custom mipmaps.
copied 1st swizzled layer ( 512x512 ) into 2nd mipmap layer ( 256x256 )

repack it back using gust_g1t, but the image pixel is swizzled incorrectly.


i also try using only 1 layer, but only show full black image on the character.


sample :

original dds sample extract using gust_g1t from PC00_Scl.g1t ( 1st and 2nd layer have different swizzle order ? )

Yes helped to see original model and exporting unswizzled texture.

But not for swizzling back and repack to g1t.
