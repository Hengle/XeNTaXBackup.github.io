Hello ..   WE need your help and we are even ready to PAY $ you for job..

issue is we are not able to play this game ASHES CRICKET 2009 online anymore since 2011 as the servers from Codemasters (creator's of the game) were closed and we no longer be able to play the game online unfortunately.. but we desperately still want this game to be played online via some 3rd party servers like tunngle etc.. can you help ? i am noob in this scripts stuff.. but i can pay you for it.. or let me know any person who can do it, create a patch to remove the old server and create LAN option in game or give us idea how we possibly can play the game online... 
ISsue is the game online section demands username and password to connect with its server (codemasters servers, but they are closed) any way we can change the server to some other server manage by us or a 3rd party ?

if you could just extract all the files from 2gb async.big.w32 file.. you may be able to reach the server files in game.,, and change the address etc,,, ur idea?
