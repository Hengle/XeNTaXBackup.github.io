If your friend knows how to open it maybe you should ask directly...

It is a technical solution since your friend has the solution to open it using a program.
I don't know what marmoset is (all I'm getting are rows and rows of monkeys in google).

But other than that I guess you can post some samples and someone might recognize how to work with it.

I really don't see the difference between asking people here (who might know how to open it) and asking your friend (who seemingly does know how to open it).

It is the easiest way to get an answer to your question rather than getting someone else to look into it.

Yes finale00, what is wrong with you?! We can't ask our so-called good friends to share knowledge or information with us, especially trivial information that might grant us the ability to open game models! THIS ISN'T SOME KIND OF COMMUNIST RELATIONSHIP WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND, WHY?!?!?!?!?! IT'S NOT LIKE THE ORIGINAL POSTER IS COMPLETELY FULL OF SHIT AND LASHING OUT AGGRESSIVELY TO AVOID BEING CALLED ON HIS INITIAL BULLSHIT!!! GOD!!!!!!!1111

Legu: So yeah, try importing your model(s) with their evaluation software. chrrox just gave you the link. If you can't import them with it, then I guess your so-called friend is full of shit, eh? Or is he dead now? Is that why you can't ask him? As he lay dying, his final words to you must have been "Legu...use the Marmoset, Legu." Little did you know, he simply felt you could use a monkey companion in your life.

Allright if even the so called "moderator" is using caps lock and bad language i dont really want to have any more replies from u ppl. I never thought that the nivou is so low here. I found cool topics on this site , so im quite dissapointed. 

Im really sorry that u ppl dont know the program marmorset, however im quite impressed that some of you could use google and found it. Awesome work!

So how great is Marmoset?
It looks like it supports a lot of stuff but how easy is it to work with?

Maybe if it were free........

Actually it claimed to be a good program. Can do many many things , i basicly use it for (.mesh) but it probaly must be able to open .mdl too...somehow. 

I need to export it and rip the source code from it. I just dont know how to export it. It only allows to put .mesh and other things there.

Just drop the marmoset thing already it will not open fear 2 models.

> Toolbag is a full-featured, real-time material editor and presentation tool bundled in a small package. As a stand-alone toolkit, Toolbag provides 3D artists an efficient workflow to bring exceptional presentation to models, texture sets, and animations in a real-time environment â€” all without the hassle and time-sink of shader setup or lengthy render times.

Its meant to show off artists creations without them having to set up a bunch of shaders.
Your friend might of saw someone make thier own model of a fear2 model and show it off in this program but there is no way for this program to open fear2 mdl files.

Someone would need to make a 3d model importer for the fear 2 models and then you could export from that program to a common format like obj that marmoset supports.
