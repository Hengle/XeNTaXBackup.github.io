I have extracted .big file from XBOX 360 and tried to extract these .big files with this bms script, but unable to extract.

It gives me error: "incomplete input file number 0, can't read 5284 bytes. so check it or contact its author."

But when I tried to extract the file given here, with megaupload link, is working fine.

So please tell these .big files belongs to XBOX or PS3, and how do you extract these.

Thank you very much Aluigi for really quick response and update the script.
Now its working fine, but I didn't found any texture extracted.

After extraction, it gives me lots of .xsf files.

Can you please tell if you know how to extract textures from these .xsf files.

Please...

the content of the files (graphic/models) is not my field so I'm not much useful here.
I guess it's not the first time I see these xbox xslt files (those RW4xb2 headers there are familiar) but that's all I know

(suggestion, search "rw4xb2" on google!)

Thank you very much Aluigi.

Hope I will find some solution to extract .xsf file with RW4xb2 headers.

Do you know what type of CRC is used? I've used a standard CRC checksum and it doesnt match the one in the file table.

Hello,

yes, I know it's a old thread but I have a problem with extracting some files from the Xbox 360 version with the provided script.

I'm able to extract some files, but it doesn't work with the marquee.big and parkassets.big files which are located in /data/content.

I've uploaded screenshots of the seemingly similar error messages:

Furthermore I have uploaded the first 10 MB of each file:

Hopefully some of you is willing and able to help me with this problem.

Thank you very much!
