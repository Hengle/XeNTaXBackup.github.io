This issue has been discussed before. You need any or (older?) version of COMCTL32.OCX

If you simply Google the error you get : 

```
The error 35613 indicates that the COMCTL32.OCX file on your system is either not the correct version or is not registered correctly,
```


Google is your friend, remember that.
