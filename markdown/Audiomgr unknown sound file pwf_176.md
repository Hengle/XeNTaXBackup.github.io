I think you are at the wrong forum here. I suggest seeking Delta Force forums for an answer to your problem. This forum is basically intended to discuss issues with MultiEx Commander.

It seems to me you all must have something in common. This problem is not found on the regular DF forums. 

Some kind of Audiomanager is obviously trying to play a *.PWF file, which it doesn't recognize as a supported sound file, and fails to play. 

Here' s what Novalogic say about crashing after the intro movie :

> This situation usually occurs when the device drivers running your graphics card / sound card are not compatible with your version of Microsoft’s DirectX (http://www.microsoft.com/directx/). This, in most cases, can quickly resolved by installing updated drivers that can be download from the device manufacturer’s web site.

You could also try to see if any programs are associated with file using the .pwf extension. I know that PWF files are Delta Forces sound files, and it doesn't seem reasonable to assume that Delta Force could not recognize its own sound format, so some external force should be in play. I don't know, but if DirectX can play PWF files, and your drivers are not up to date with the DirectX needed or some other compatability issue, then it might explain the error. 

But first you all should try and see what you have in common regarding your computer systems.

I had the same problem, I uninstall the game(in my case blackhawk down) and then make sure you delete the novalogic folder.  And then reinstall the game and update game.  I try to uninstall and reinstall the game without deleting the nova folder and it didn't work untill I deleted the nova folder.  Hope this helps
