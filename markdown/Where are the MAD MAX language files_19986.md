- Post Title: Where are the MAD MAX language files

I got the .arc files out but "master_gui_eng.stringlookup" there is only one such file. Some subtitles do not exist in this language file. Where are the other files. Is there anyone who knows. I left a link for the following file. Please help me

I have a text tool but I can only access a single language file and this language file contains only certain subtitles. I want to locate other subtitle files
