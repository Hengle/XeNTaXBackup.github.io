This is  a max script to import geometry with uv's
the texture will be applied but it assumes the mesh and texture are in the same directory.

Nice, I was staring at it for awhile trying to figure out what those weird tags were supposed to mean lol

There are multiple ID's that indicate the texture section. You have found 12505350. 17505350 is also one of them. There may be more.

Not problem with the models with a single texture, but with the models of Multiple Textures doesnt work, check this graphic..

Here you can see the 3 objects of the file imported, and see the Textures, Object 01 and Object 03 are Right, but Object 02 are wrong cause this its fusioned with a rare copy of the Object 03, if you try asign texture to this Object 02 you can see the error in the hands and legs of this insect, the problem its with all the models with multiple textures. 


Same error in Archlords
This Model have around 5 Textures separated for each part of the body, Hands, Gloves, Legs, Head, but the models its Flated too in a single object mesh, cause of this if you asign a texture this looks bad.


Here a link with the meshes and textures in the normal format extracted with quickbms, ready to import in max.

Thanks and Regards.well here the testm without problems, you need select parts, can't drop texture into model because sometimes is not only 1 texture they have, in this case the model are divided in 3 parts but use only 2 textures, jsut need select parts and all worked fine, same for ArchLord, I don't show it because is same like explain before, cheers and hope you understand.

/es

bueno aqui la prueba sin problemas, lo que necesitas es selecionar las partes, no podes dropiar la textura en el modelo a causa de que aveces no es solo 1 textura que tienen, en este caso el modelo esta divido en 3 partes but usa 2 texturas para el mapeado, solo necesitas seleccionar las partes y todo funcionara bien, lo mismo para Archlord, no muestro la captura porque es lo mismo que explique antes para Maestia, saludos y espero que lo hayas entendido.
