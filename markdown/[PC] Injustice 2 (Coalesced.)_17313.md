Hello.
Does anybody know how to edit "Coalesced" file? I can unpack, but I can't repack. I need your help.
Thank you.

decrypt and encrypt is really easy to do(with a little coding), but extract is not a big deal too
and im looking for a way to use UTF-8 in Coalesced.eng
Any body know that? (a way to set UTF-8 in Coalesced)
