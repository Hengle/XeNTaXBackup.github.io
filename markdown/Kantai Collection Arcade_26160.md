Hey guys, recently Kancolle Arcade was dumped, but i haven't found a proper working exporting script for models.
Can somebody help with exporting it?

Noesis weirdly exports bone structure and renaming shape keys.

In the Project Diva Noesis script I deleted the VMD on line 4 (since it was having issues)
I exported as .GLTF and got these results in blender, It didn't export any of the shape keys you could try other formats for different results.

GLTF doesn't export shape keys.

GLTF doesn't export shape keys.

The latest project diva script supports models without editing needed, as well as latest FGO files. As for shapekeys, try fbx instead as that has shapekeys/morphs. Gltf doesn't support them. Latest public build, for anyone that still needs it [https://github.com/h-kidd/noesis-project-diva](https://github.com/h-kidd/noesis-project-diva)

Hey, I know this is an old thread, but are there any leads on where I can find the dump? I've been searching for quite a bit but can't seem to find any mention of it anywhere besides here. Did any of you also figure out how to export the models with mostly everything in-tact? Thanks in advance!
