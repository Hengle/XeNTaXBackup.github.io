- Post Title: Leatherface 3D Model From Mortal Kombat XL

Can someone rip out the leatherface model from Mortal Kombat XL?
I've search the internet but I can't found one,
but there're other 3d Model Character from Mortal Kombat XL though (Like Jason Voorhees, scorpion, etc), and there is none for leatherface
Thanks

No one can rip models from PS4-Xbooxone games. Other models are from MKX PC version

Okay, I never know that Mortal Kombat XL is exclusive, only for Xbox One & PS4

BTW, I've don't have any copy of Mortal Kombat X PC version, does it include leatherface too?
Cause from this IGN article it says Mortal Kombat X has a leatherface character
