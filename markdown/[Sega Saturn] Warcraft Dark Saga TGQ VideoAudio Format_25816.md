- Post Title: [Sega Saturn] Warcraft Dark Saga TGQ Video/Audio Format

I've been having trouble playing back the audio in the TGQ videos from the Sega Saturn version of Warcraft the Dark Saga. 
When I tried to download the ffmpeg codex, the videos only play for a few seconds.
When I try to use the demultiplexer (found here [viewtopic.php?t=4450&start=240](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=4450&start=240)), I can't find anything able to recognize the audio file.

Does anyone have any idea how to extract the audio out of those videos so it can be converted into .WAV.

Thank you,
Andrew
