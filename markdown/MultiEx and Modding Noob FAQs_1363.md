- Post Title: MultiEx and Modding Noob FAQs?

!

Ack, this is embarrassing.....

I apologize if there is an FAQ or answer for me on the forum or site somewhere around, then you could lock this thread if you wanted to. But I dont quite understand some things here.

As a completely new modder, (and yay for me, I have to pick a challenge   )  I want to understand what really MultiEx can do, and how to use it. I know that is said about sort of.  But what I mean specifically is the following:

Ok so I can't hex edit or program or anything of the sort.  I just want to be able to access and extract game files that a friend can help me with play with (textures, models, sounds, animation files, script, everything or as much as possible atleast).  And when a game is not supported, and I cant explore the archives myself, that is where the requesting thread comes in handy for kind people to take a looksie for me. But then I ask you, THEN what?    

So someone finds something interesting in the files and is able to make a script of it so that Multiex can recognise it. But I dont know what to do with that script.  So it is either up to me to figure out how to add it to multiex myself, OR, the people running this place will add it to the next update of the program?  So what do I do with this script to be able to access the files, before the new update is out?

The next scenerio:  Files are available to toy with thanks to MultiEx and the people who wrote the script for it. But I'm a complete noob to modding. People would surely like to tell me to 'google it' to learn how to mod games that do not come with a SDK, but the problem is that I absolutely suck at searching for stuff online.    Google is really only slightly less sucky than all search engines.  But as expert or veteran modders (anyone here?) SURELY some of you know of some great resources/sites/FAQs/tools, et all to get me started?  Me = the overwhelmed but full of ideas noob willing to learn and work hard on what I ain't good at.     But NOT lazy. I'm NOT trying to get everyone to do stuff FOR me, its just that the first step/getting into this/learning this is the hardest step of all, where I need the most help. No?

Ahh.... it would all come together much easier if I was already in my game production classes in college, but I am not just yet. In fact I have taken a break off my studies until further notice as all the work and social pressure and stuff proved too much for me to handle and I just have stuff in my life I need to sort out thats more of a priority than career right now.  But that doesnt mean on my break that I cant be practicing modding and modelling and stuff to get me some experience. Hell, I've even been working on a big-deal FanGame in the last year!  Well I'm just doing the character art, and I have a large part of planning out some of the gameplay and story, but so far I've only been drawing for it.

Well this is a long enough post. I would just find it interesting if anyone could help point me in the right direction either at this site that I may have missed, and other links. You could also use this topic to discuss getting into modding games and the challenge and fun of it.    

Thanks very much! Ta ta for now.
