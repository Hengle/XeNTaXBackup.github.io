- Post Title: Star Trek: The Next Generation - A Final Unity

I'm hoping that someone can add support for some (more) Star Trek games to MultiEx. I own probably every popular Star Trek game that has been released since the early 1990s, and would love to be able to export files from these games' archives for use for various Star Trek-related modifications, websites, and of course for my own sense of nosiness! 

I can provide people with files from any Star Trek game on request, but I was hoping to start my fun with one of the best Star Trek games from the mid 1990s - Star Trek: The Next Generation - A Final Unity. Most of the files are useless to modern requirements (such as the textures for models, and sprites, however the sound/audio/speech files are of great importance and usefulness for me and many other people in various modding communities. 

I have so far been unable to open the '.vac' files that (as far as I can tell) hold the data for the audio/speech files that populate the game with hours of audio recorded by the real Star Trek: The Next Generation cast.

I am so eager to be able to access/convert these files, that I would like to offer a cash incentive to anyone who has the specialist skills or knowledge to be able to make these files accessible to me (as well as donating to the developers of MultiEx, obviously ). If anyone thinks that they can manage to generate MultiEx support for the sound files (see the attached Archive.zip which includes a small random selection of .vac files from the game's CD), please let me know!
