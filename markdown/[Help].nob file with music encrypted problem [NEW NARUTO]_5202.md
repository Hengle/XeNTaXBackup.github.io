It's not encrypted...........I can perfectly see the files and data....
I think you meant "decode"

Anyway, I'll just make a convert kit like I do for 360 games with custom XMA stuff.

EDIT: Here it is:

Thanks.

Here you go [Naruto Shippuden - Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 (x360) ToWav XMA Convert Kit.zip](http://download1323.mediafire.com/yd3wkq8eulqg/4x32is0qc0dbs95/Naruto+Shippuden+-+Ultimate+Ninja+Storm+2+%28x360%29+ToWav+XMA+Convert+Kit.zip)

You know, XMA converting should be switched over to VGMToolbox since we created a frontend for the XMA Parser+ToWav.
