- Post Title: .msh, .roc, .coc, .sgh, .geo, .skn, .pvs, File types from Computer Artworks' The Thing

Hoping someone can help me figure out these files and how to convert them to something usable, I extracted them with Dragon UnPACKer and I have tried Noesis and Model Researcher. Noesis doesn't recognize any of them and I have no idea where to start with Model Researcher. [I have attached one of each file type](https://mega.nz/folder/1kAliSzS#lQ79hHBK8GbM2LvHOQP0Qg). I believe .msh is the most important as that seems to be used for the level objects.

I released the The Thing .msh loader module on December 16, 2016.

How to get the 3D Object Converter:
Download the 3D Object Converter from [ http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version (if you don’t have it yet).
