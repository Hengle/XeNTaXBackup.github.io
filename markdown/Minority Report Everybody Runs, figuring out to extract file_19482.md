- Post Title: Minority Report Everybody Runs, figuring out to extract file

Need some assistance figuring out how Minority Report for PS2 Works. The folder structure is quite interesting. A lot of .PAK files. I'll upload the ISO here if anyone is interested. 
Link to ISO: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/3rme9xhf ... USA%29.iso](https://www.mediafire.com/file/3rme9xhfrvk32e7/Minority+Report+%28USA%29.iso)
My main goals for this is extracting the models maps and textures really.

The structure of the .ISO works as pictured


The HERO/ Directory has .GZ files for I assume to be models? 
The models when you open them up in winRAR are in .PAK format, but I'm not sure what specific .PAK format, what would I use to extract it? Since the game has to be run on an emulator, does this also change anything? Looking for all the help I can get. 
Textures are in a .TM2 file format. 
Movies are in UPI and PSS.
