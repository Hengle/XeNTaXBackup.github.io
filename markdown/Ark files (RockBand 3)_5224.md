- Post Title: Ark files (RockBand 3)

Im trying to open the ARK files in Rock Band 3.  Normally they open up fine in Arktool 7.  But for some reason they dont work now.  
There are 9 ark files and a header file.

Im not sure how I would upload them.  The ARK files are about 5.47 GB.  Personally I think its the ARK.HDR thats causing the problem for ARKtool7.  So should I try to upload all the ark files or just the header file?

Is that what is needed?  I could do each ark file in its own DL.  There are 10 Ark files plus this header and I think they are all needed to have a chance of opening it up.

I cant seem to get that program to work.  I get it all loaded up and hit Go! then I see a little window that says "cutter" "ok".  So I hit ok and one more window just like it comes up.  I hit ok again and it looks like its done but there is No new file where I told the program to put it.

Just to explain why you cant extract ARK files using arktool 7...

Every so often harmonix updated the song encryption, when there was an RB1/RB2 update it was usually an encryption update. they had to do it to try and stop people from ripping off there master tracks ( which lets be honest, thats what we all want right    )

Arktool 7 will still extract stuff, but only stuff that was before the last update ( which was in July 09 ) so the original RB2 disk songs can be extracted and even the AC/DC song pack can be extracted.  but nothing after that date.  Now the guy that created Arktool DID figure out how to decrypt the data after that last update. but was VERY quickly employed by harmonix on the understanding he removes his current copy of arktool from its main DL source  and NEVER reveals how to crack the new encryption.  So that takes you up to and just after July 09.  Since then RB 3 has been made and yet again they changed the encryption and also a major change to all the DLC making it RB3 compatible ( they did the same to the DLC for RB1 when RB2 came out)

so don't worry about arktool not working.. it hasn't worked properly since last year..  the best way we can go about this is if some amazing dude ( or dudette ) here can figure out the encryption. coz if they do, not only will they give us access to  the RB3 songs, but also the RB2 DLC that we could never extract.

So come on guys  we NEEED your help  

Edit*   just to let you know what you should find in an ark file ( for the RB games )  they should contain a MOGG ( multi track .ogg file ) and a Midi file, it may also contain some kind of text document like a .ini ( as this is the file that contains the song title and artist ) but arktool  never used to extract those it just extracted the mogg and the midi. 
 hope that info may help in some way..

Nobby..

I used file cutter set to its largest size 1024k to get a start and end chunk of data.
I did it on a couple of different ark files ( as someone else pointed out, there is 10 ark files in total ) So i chose Ark's 0,1 and 7. Hope these will be enough for someone to take a look at.  if you need bigger files and there is a way to make filecutter do bigger sizes, please do tell . i couldn't see anything obvious tho.

[Ark 0](http://www.mediafire.com/?rl882z3lkc38ped)
[Ark 1](http://www.mediafire.com/?84z5lgwd18aol5q)
[Ark 7](http://www.mediafire.com/?ni284ya9kb8nskj)

Hopefully some one will figure out how to extract the ark's and write a nice little extractor exe for us.

The most likely way that someone will crack the encryption is if someone was to reverse engineer the executable of the game and find out how it works that way.

Or they could just have a go at trying to decrypt the ark files that they asked for.. not trying to be funny, but if someone like chrrox says post a sample of the file you want cracked, thats exactly what im gonna do.   ive seen him crack so many things, that if he said "yeah ill need you to actually slice off part of the dvd and post it to me" id probably do that too   


Now with a bit of luck someone will take a look at the ark files and see if they can find anything. lets hope ..

i had to look up the release dates for the acdc track pack and everywhere i looked said Nov 2nd 09 for Xbox, ps3 and ps2. so thats the date i went with. and i know the acdc pack can be extracted coz ive extracted it myself with arktool7  (since then i looked it up again and found other places that  said it was released nov 2nd 08

Nope no change, if there was you would see it here..

Altho i know some people have found "other" ways of getting the master tracks without using extraction methods, i just don't know how they did it. a few of my friends have all the rb3, gh4,5,6 songs saved as moggs

it was released November 2, 2008. the encryption old there (SongCrypt-capable).

"other" ways to get tracks are pretty lame ^-/
they are lossy, unneccesary frq. resample involved, and etc.
and what worse they are not perfectly aligned (tracks time)

Ahh you must be getting the crap versions then, coz the songs i have are in exactly the same frq and sample rate as the extracted RB2 songs, Oh and they all line up perfectly.. And they sound just as good a quality as any other RB song.

Wait, where'd you get this from? The RB3 disc? I tried disassembling the .xex myself but PPC assembly is a foreign language to me; there was nothing that was obviously a decryption/encryption key.

And sorry for the necropost.
