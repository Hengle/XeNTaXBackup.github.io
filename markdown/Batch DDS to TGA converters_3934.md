- Post Title: Batch DDS to TGA converters

Following the thread here: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2848&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&start=120](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2848&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&start=120)

I was able to extract all the meshes, sounds, animations, etc.

However, I have been unable to find a batch converter for DDS -> TGA format.  If you know of any good ones (for free) please let me know.  Also, please don't mention DDS Converter 2.X because I've tried that and you have to load all the DDS files individually.
