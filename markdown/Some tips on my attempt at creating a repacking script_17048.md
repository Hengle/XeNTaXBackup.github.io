- Post Title: Some tips on my attempt at creating a repacking script

Hello,

I am attempting to create a repacking script for QuickBMS for a game that I wish to modify.

User Ekey was kind enough to provide me with his extracting script in this link:
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=13147](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=13147)

For past several days I have looked into various forum posts regarding building a repacking script, but it appears that I will need to learn much more skills before I can begin to do this. May I have some tips on this subject? Thank you.
