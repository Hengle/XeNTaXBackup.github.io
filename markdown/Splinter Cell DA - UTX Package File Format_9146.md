- Post Title: Splinter Cell: DA - UTX Package File Format

Hello,
it's a long time ago when I was trying to crack up the UTX-archive's of splinter cell double agent. It looks like, that the UTX-archives simply holds DDS.-textures inside. And I would really like to extract them. Some years ago, someone from this forum was able to extract the DDS-textures from the archives.

So, who is able to analyse the archive-structure of that files?

 I've uploaded a few, which you can test:

Can you provide the smallest .UTX file instead?

Hey,
sure: [http://easyupload.net/files/get/TpLF8F6wT1/icones.utx](http://easyupload.net/files/get/TpLF8F6wT1/icones.utx)
Like the filename tells us, this archive seems to hold the icons.

I'm not really sure what I've did that years ago, but that was, what my UTX-loader was looking like: (still not working)
