- Post Title: ripping tracks from d1 grand prix (ps2)

hello guys

so i figured out ripping cars from this game from [this](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=15749) post (converting .bin to .dff and importing in zmodeler 2, and converting .bin to .txd for textures) but i haven't been able to figure out tracks.

the tracks for this game are in .d1 format, and if i convert them to .txd same as cars, it gives me the textures. the problems comes when i convert to .dff. upon importing the dff into zmodeler 2, i'm greeted with what looks like a skybox surrounded by a bunch of random triangles. i've tried looking through the sky for the track to no avail. this happens with all of the .d1 files that i've tried thus far.

if anyone knows how to import the tracks from this game please help, i'll be forever indebted to you
