Hi, some time ago GD1 and GD2 of this game were released for Dreamcast, and I would like to replace the FMV audios of the PC version, since they are in my language.
The specific files have a .CNM extension, but the structure of the PC fmv with respect to the DC version is somewhat different.
I managed to find a scumvm decoder although I don't know how to use it, but maybe it can help for a possible script

In this zip I provide the same fmv of both versions
