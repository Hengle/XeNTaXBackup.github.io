yeah i see vertices at the start of the file, and some sections of faces, probably separated based on strips or based on the how the program creates the paper folds. too lazy to try and import models, cause i'm pretty sure theres other ways to get the PDO models converted.

I've scoured the internet looking for ways to convert them on my own, and in fact there once was a converter back in 2006: [http://web.t-online.hu/karpo/](http://web.t-online.hu/karpo/)

3D Object Converter, used to be able to convert them and it still can, but only with old outdated files from a previous version of the format. It's no longer compatible with the models that are produced now.

Thanks for at least looking and confirming there is real data in there for anyone who may look in the future. But I'm fairly certain that there aren't any existing methods. This is why I decided to break down and ask here.

The stupid company changed the file format because of that.

Hi Zerox!
It's a pleasure to greet you. I've worked with this program for a while, and if you want to obtain models it's very easy.
Also exists the program Pepakura Designer. This program is used to unfold models 3D and turning them into templates, for later to be able to build them in paper.
This is a program of payment, but with this program, you can convert directly the model to the format OBJ. The problem is that it doesn't export textures, just the model.
Some files PDO, are protected with password, and only you can open them with the Pepakura Viewer, because they don't open in the Pepakura Designer, only if you have the password.

I have a Pepakura Designer that is cracked, and it doesn't needs register. This program will open any file PDO, although it be protected with any password. Normally those who make Papercraft protect their works to avoid that they be modified.
Just you have to open this program and to select the file PDO. Later you'll find some options to export the model.
You see the image here:



The problem are the textures! It doesn't export textures, just the model.
I hope this may help you. I send you a personal message.


Regards!

yeah with a forum of programmers, and some who make programs for a living... maybe it wasnt such a good idea to be talking about program piracy lol

ohwell, least we know that these files were redesigned for content security, maybe we should just leave it alone.

Uh Warez are against the rules here, it's nice to see someone want to help but none the less warez aren't allowed. But I wasn't aware the full version could export the models back to a normal format. I'll look into how much it costs, that or I'll just attempt to get the models from the games I want the old fashioned way.

I guess there really isn't a need for the topic then if there is a way of getting to the model data. Though if someone wanted to make something free still that'd be cool too. Thanks anyway.  

Edit: Before I threw the cash down I figured I'd research the export feature, and apparently what it does is it exports the mesh but it exports it with a UV map set to fit the pdf print out of the model instead of the original texture. So in that case I'm not wasting the $40's. I'll just try to rip from an actual game instead.

seems silly to me to invest any time on this format. since most models that are imported are ripped models from other games to begin with. it sounds dodgy that your trying to rip models from an app of ripped models.. why not just get the rips from the source?

I could understand, if maybe there are some user created models. but honestly, if they wanted people mucking with their work, they would have supplied the model with the upload.

In earnest I mostly wanted to convert the N64 models in hopes their uvmaps would be fixed up already. But as I already said I can just get them from their original source.

Oops! Too much violence!
Relax guys, I don't intend to offend nobody, neither disobeying the rules of this site!

I have the original program that I bought. I don't need to cash in on the work of nobody.
Only I offered a partial solution to Zerox, like he mentions it, with the intention of a real help. That's all.

Zerox; Not all models of video games are better. Just some ingenuous kids think that these models are better.
There are hundred of people in internet that create better models 3D, and besides they offer them for free.
The models PDO, are not directly models 3D original, because these need to be modified through the some programs like 3D Max, Maya, Metasequoia, for an easier realization in paper.
Reduction of polygons, unnecessary parts, etc.
As I mentioned you, if you have any doubt, we can comment it.


Regards.

Has there been any progress on deciphering the new binary 
PDO file format?  Alternately, does anyone know of an import/export
function in an existing package to read new binary PDO and 
export to old ASCII PDO? 

I would like to extract the 2D data to export to a water jet cutter
so that I can make objects out of thin metal or plastic sheet.
Tama currently provides an interface to CraftROBO paper
cutters.

Thanks

what model do you want to sculpt out of plastic? cause your not going to get it through PDO

The primary use is to build 1/6 scale tank turrets and
hulls for RC Tank Combat.  Please see [www.rctankcombat.com](http://www.rctankcombat.com)
Our vehicles typically are 3 to 4 feet long and weigh 100
to 200 pounds.  They are radio controlled and carry paintball
guns for cannons.

PDO is particularly interesting because many full-size tanks are
actually constructed using welded plates.

I already have PDO files for several tanks and have tested
two approaches.

1) Construct using thick paper and paint with resin used 
for fiberglass.  Add fiberglass cloth for strengthening.

2) Print onto paper, glue onto sheet metal or thin plastic,
cut with a band saw and then join with welding or adhesives.
You must obviously adjust folding tab sizes to account
for bending metal/plastic versus folding paper.

Access to PDO 2D data would allow us to scale to larger 
sizes that we need and to cut directly on a water
jet with much greater precision.

I know, don't bump old threads, it's rude, blah blah.
[http://uppit.com/psx3tn8va1b8/Pdo2mqo.zip](http://uppit.com/psx3tn8va1b8/Pdo2mqo.zip)
It's a zip containing a pepakura file containing a model containing textures of a python script that converts the .pdo format 3D data to metasequoia format (which 3dsmax plugins can load if you don't have metasequoia).
Does the textures to .bmp, however i'm far too lazy to write a function that re-reverses the face orientation, you can do that in any cad package. 
If your wondering why it's in .pdo format - i'm just nasty 

@Anvilus9
The 2D data isn't that much use to you as pepakura can save as .dxf for your jet flow machine anyway. Just re-unfold the 3D model the way you want it.
