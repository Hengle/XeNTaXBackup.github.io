What do you mean by entire map? terrain + LOD or just Terrain?


I don't think there's a nice and easy way to do it, I would try Ninjaripper.

If you only want the terrain maybe you can make a plane and add a displacement modifier with the heightmap of NV game world.

He's the hegihtmap: [https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/images/31353](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/images/31353)

i found something called Elder Scrolls Explorer that can load the terrain and all of the static models on it. it is in java i wonder if it can be mod so it can export the map [https://github.com/philjord/ElderScrollsExplorer](https://github.com/philjord/ElderScrollsExplorer)
