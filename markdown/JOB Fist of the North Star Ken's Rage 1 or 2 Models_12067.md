Hi 
Here is importer for *.bin files from Fist of the North Star Ken's Rage  2 PS3.
It requires Blender249 and Python 26.
What is to be done:
- reading some types of images from g1t archive
- transform meshes to right position
- fixing skinweights for some type of meshes 
- animations
In Blender Text Window press alt+p and select *.bin files from ..\Action\model.

000_Kenshiro_base_mdl.bin - use offzip, but this file has only images, no meshes
000_Kenshiro_base_tex.g1t - too small

thanks
i think, the file structure of extracted ns2_360.bms is incorrect...

then how about this one?
this is XB DLC of Ken's Rage 2
it seems include G1M and G1T as raw hex

guys i want to mod the wii u g1m & g1t version of ken2 for cemu emulator. 
blender script doesn't recognize models or texture, don't know if it's header problem or compression
type... 0 knowledge of python and scripts 

blender error: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "formatG1m.py", line 773, in openFile
    parser=Parser()
  File "formatG1m.py", line 700, in Parser
    data+=zlib.decompress(g.read(size))
zlib.error: Error -3 while decompressing data: unknown compression method

here is a sample of the g1m & g1t from wii u linkdata: [https://ufile.io/pl7sj](https://ufile.io/pl7sj) 

hope you can help. thanks

If you have a working sample (that doesn't cause that traceback error) there's a small chance to analyse what goes wrong with the none-working sample.

From the sample 000_Kenshiro_base_tex.g1t I'd say it's not zlib compressed, thus causing the error.

Trying to cure this I got a step ahead, 'til the next traceback error:

thanks shakotay2, i was dumb not to post working sample sorry. here: [https://ufile.io/6flkc](https://ufile.io/6flkc)

they have complete different headers (hope it's where the solution can be),

too bad the traceback was useless, hope you can figure it out with those files.

anyway thank you for helping me

well, that's not "dumb" - most people don't know the importance of a working sample (and sometimes there isn't any)

anyways, I've a workaround for your not working sample (mesh only, the texture is wrong):
you need to use any working texture and rename it to 000_kenshiro_base_tex.g1t,
make a copy of 000_Kenshiro_base_mdl.bin and rename it to 000_Kenshiro_base_mdl.bin.dec,
then comment out nine lines in the script (by #, view picture):



000_Kenshiro_base_mdl-wrong_tex.jpg (155.5 KiB) Viewed 242 times



You may try using the same "commenting out" trick to load the not working texture.
But seems the def g1tParser() needs some adjustments?

incredible... thank you! it's a nice turnaround. but i can't make it work for me.

i tried to put the modifications on the script (i saved it on a new .blend file), i've put the "non"working g1m and a working g1t (same name):
result: blender don't load any mesh (no error on traceback...) but dump the texture in folder. i don't know where my mistake is.

here is a vid: [https://youtu.be/T7fcOWOnxRg](https://youtu.be/T7fcOWOnxRg)

sorry it looks easy to do, but i failed

looks like you missed:
"make a copy of 000_Kenshiro_base_mdl.bin and rename it to 000_Kenshiro_base_mdl.bin.dec"

(I had edited that line later into my post, maybe in your browser's cache there's the old version of my post?)

yep i didn't see the copy .bin+.dec line. and now the mesh work like intended. it's great. i'll try the same method for the g1t and run some tests. i'll come back later to feedback.
thanks for your help again

EDIT (15/10/2017) : ok with your technique i can open pretty much every g1m xbox, ps3 or wiiu  
for g1t... not always (parser thing prob?..) i need to test furthermore. i can already focus on g1m anyway  but... let's say i remove parts on model, how do i save changes on g1m or bin? 

(sounds pretty obvious, but i don't see g1m/bin export option and saving on .bin result in .bin.blend, and changing extension does not seems to work. i don't really get it.)

or is there another way to unpack g1m & g1t, modify things and rebuild? like a bms script g1t to dds\ dds to g1t. noesys can export but no import if i remember it correctly. maybe i'll stick with the blender method if i can find a way to export things. what's the easyer/best option? 
(sry to ask things again) thanks

Generally the "reverse way" requires a FULL format analysing.
If it's removing only (not changing) there's a chance to set the concerning vertices to 0.0 0.0 0.0 or set the face indices to f 1 1 1.
But you'd need to identify where the data is in the g1m file.

(Don't have the time to check that.)

i'll do what i can...
anyway thank you very much for your time. i'll try to reach the hokuto team... best and last option.

good continuation shakotay2, see you.
