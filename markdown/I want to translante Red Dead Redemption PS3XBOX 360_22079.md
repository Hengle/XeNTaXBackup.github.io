- Post Title: I want to translante Red Dead Redemption PS3/XBOX 360

I have 2 issues:

1- I have XBOX 360 text files but they are in .xst format (like the gxt of the GTA series)
I didn't find any tool that would help me edit the files.

2- I can't extract the game's .edat files.
I tried to use a tool made for GTA, but it asks Klicense and I don't have it.
another tool showed me a Klicense but it appears as incorrect

I put some files attached, if anyone wants to analyze and the screenshots
