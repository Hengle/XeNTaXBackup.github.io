- Post Title: Carnivores 2 CD *.cab

Anyone care to have a look at this? There are three CAB files on the Carnivores 2 CD: _sys1.cab, which is 172 kb; _user1.cab, which is 4963 kb; and data1.cab, which is 74915 kb (you can guess which one I'm *really* interested in). I've attached _sys1.cab to my post, let me know if you want more samples.

Now that I checked, the install disk for Carnivores has three CAB files with the same names as their C2 counterparts; _sys1.cab (which I've also attached here for an extra sample) is 178 kb, _user1.cab is 2013 kb, and data1.cab is 46314 kb.

I would assume, based on this, that Carnivores Ice Age's CD has the same three files, but unfortunately I don't own CIA and so can't verify this.

Never mind - these are InstallShield CAB files, which I was able to extract using the excellent [Universal Extractor](http://legroom.net/software/uniextract) (did anyone else here know about this particular extractor before?).
