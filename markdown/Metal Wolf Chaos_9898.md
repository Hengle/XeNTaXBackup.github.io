- Post Title: Metal Wolf Chaos

Hi,
I have been looking at some files on my copy of the old XBox game, Metal Wolf Chaos. The game was made by From Software (makers of Chromehounds and the Armored Core games) in 2004. Japan only.

The model format (at least for the player character) is split into three separate files - .mdl, .smd, and .m2a files. Everything else (maps and enemies) is archived into .dat and .prm files.

The game is pretty obscure, I know, but there seemed to be a couple of mech fans on here. I was hoping to find some support for this game. At least for the player character.

Any takers?

try to look at the OTOGI thread, same studio/editor, and same extension files, maybe with some luck/tweak you will be able to get something works.
