- Post Title: Liveplex Engine GFPK Extractor

I dared to make this.

I have created a small program for extracting gfpk archives from Dragona Online and Scarlet Blade, I know chrrox made bms script, and I used it a lot, but then I came to main problem, that was cutted off filenames and script didnt make directories. For example AG effects was nearly impossible to extract for me, so I created this tool. It is also my public cpp kickstarter since I worked on some classes and wanted to use them 

This little thingy will Extract everything from gfpk, include nested directories and full filenames.
Tool supports both Dragona and Scarlet (Queen's) Blade MMO games.

Update: 

If you use UAC and trying to extract gfpk in restricted folder, tool prints out files are extracted but they are not, launch it as Administrator.

I encountered with release version that on certain locations (path where certain gfpk is) tool just crashes. To solve this problem, move gfpk file somewhere else.

Nevermind, I've got it.
Your Tool can extract only Textures from .gfpk Archives, right?
