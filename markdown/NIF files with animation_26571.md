- Post Title: NIF files with animation

Hi I have a problem.
So I have a skeleton.nif and animation.kf of a model.
When I import those in nif skope it works perfectly.
If I import them in blender using 0.15v plugin I got this result : [https://prnt.sc/v-4gi_WknnDp](https://prnt.sc/v-4gi_WknnDp)
and this is how it should like : [https://prnt.sc/UwqBTbvGKZlI](https://prnt.sc/UwqBTbvGKZlI)

Skeleton : [https://www.sendspace.com/file/6s6fu0](https://www.sendspace.com/file/6s6fu0)
Animation : [https://www.sendspace.com/file/svpnnj](https://www.sendspace.com/file/svpnnj)
Mesh : [https://www.sendspace.com/file/ylikro](https://www.sendspace.com/file/ylikro)
It would be nice if someone could help me with this I want to have proper animations in blender.
