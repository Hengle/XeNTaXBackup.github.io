- Post Title: [REQUEST] Prince of Persia: SOT, WW, T2T noesis script

Hi everyone! Since 2010 there is the method of exposing resources from Prince of Persia: SOT, WW, T2T [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5112&p=43290&hilit ... sia#p43290](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5112&p=43290&hilit=prince+of+persia#p43290). Maybe anyone makes the script for Noesis, basing on the method?
