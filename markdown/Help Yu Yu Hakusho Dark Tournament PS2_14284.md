Hi
Please use Mediafire or Mega  or something like that to send some mdl files.
Not all want to buy  or to download by torrent this game only to help you to rip models .
If files are copyrighted = no help.

ok, here is the model link [http://www.mediafire.com/download/3fq92 ... kj/Bui.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/3fq9228g78c2akj/Bui.rar), do not understand what you meant by copyright? You see something wrong in extracting game models?
