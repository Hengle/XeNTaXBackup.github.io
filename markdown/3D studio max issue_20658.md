- Post Title: 3D studio max issue

Hello everyone,,,,

So I downloaded 3D studio max cause most of the export scripts here are written for it.
When I started it up, the "workspace" (don't know what to call it) doesn't appear correctly.
xvideos.onl/ xnxx.onl/ chaturbate.onl/
Perhaps my computer sucks or my graphics card sucks (or both, very likely), but basically the workspace is frozen. If I open a menu that expands over the workspace and then close the menu, you can still see it over the workspace.

I can import models using the scripts and I can export them to other formats, but I just can't see it in the workspace 

Is it because 3D studio requires huge amounts of resources which I may not have?
