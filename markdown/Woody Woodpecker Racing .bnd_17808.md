- Post Title: Woody Woodpecker Racing .bnd

Can't find any ripping options here so requesting help be it bms, noesis, Blender or Max.
Low poly models by any era's standard but could be useful for MKWii modding with some polishing. The example is Woody's files. I included multiple with retained directories as they are all same named and didn't want to through anything out of whack by changing the structure. 

The models are a container type as looking in text shows them to hold other files like TIM which are this games texture type and MOD which are it's animation type. Reminds me of the Nif type in full particularly how it was put to use in the Knight Rider PC game series. 

Game is by Konami though off from their typical filesystems of course and from the PC-rom version.

Going to make a few posts FYI, sorry in advance and not trying to be a pest or flooder. I've just had a couple games I tried my hand at for about a year now and haven't had any breakthroughs. Thanks for your patience.
