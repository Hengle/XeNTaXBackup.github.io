- Post Title: Titanfall 2 .RPAK and .STARPAK

Titanfall 2 uses the same slightly modified .VPK system as Titanfall 1, but it has additional .RPAK and .STARPAK files that hold textures, sound, etc. I was wondering if somebody could create a QuickBMS script for them, as I have no idea how. Most .RPAK files are accompanied by .STARPACK files, but not all of them. .STARPACK files also seem to always be exactly 5kb, possibly implying they include mostly unimportant, but common data.

There's been some discussion in the Titanfall 2 thread but no concrete information that I've seen.
I assume the .rpak, .starpak and .stbsp are all somehow related anyway.
