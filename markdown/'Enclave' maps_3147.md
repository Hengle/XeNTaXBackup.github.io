- Post Title: 'Enclave' maps

i'd love to get the maps from the game 'Enclave' by Starbreeze Studios into my 3ds max.
any ideas? the files end with *.XW

EDIT:
i believe Enclave has the same XW files as the two later publications "Knights of the Temple" and "The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay".
apparently there is more on those games:

i am only interested in the map files, those end in XW.
