- Post Title: [HELP] Nights of Azure .g1t textures from Vita

I'm working on an english port of Nights of Azure for Vita and PS3 using the PC assets, and i got a successful extraction and injection of PS3 .g1t textures using chrrox script ([viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6252&hilit=dynasty+warriors+7](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6252&hilit=dynasty+warriors+7)) as i found their header (G1TG0060) compatible with the script.

But when i come to the vita assets, the header is different (GT1G0600T), and searching on this forum i couldn't find any clue about how to extract those textures, even with another vita titles published by Koei, bc their header is different.

Is possible to someone make a script to extract the vita version texture?

Here it's a sample:

For Noesis. Download Noesis, place the file in noesis\plugins\python, then launch Noesis and try opening your files inside Noesis.

Thanks, it worked very well on UI textures, but there are other textures that the script couldn't extract, here its another example:

Redownload the script from the [2nd post](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=158890#p158890).
