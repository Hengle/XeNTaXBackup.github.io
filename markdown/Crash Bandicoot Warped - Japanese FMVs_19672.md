- Post Title: Crash Bandicoot Warped - Japanese FMVs

Most of the FMVs are playable. However, [this](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q40x0y-T-ORDWLYebDOVTb87glHOGdiW) video is just black with the wrong aspect ratio. The rest of the videos, such as [this](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tGcFC-HH-pXEf1J4rf5Z7ZSR4UqB-aaY) one, convert just fine. I am not sure if MOVIE1.IKI is somehow encoded differently or if it was the ISO I used. Could I get a second opinion, please?

After happening upon another ISO, I am fairly certain that MOVIE1.IKI is encrypted differently than the other FMVs for some reason. Still, I prefer to have a more experienced eye let me know for sure. Would there be any chance of playing the video correctly? (The links in my previous post still work for anyone who wants to help.)
