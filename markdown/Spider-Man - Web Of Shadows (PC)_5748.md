Okay so majority of the sound files can be played back just fine. Standard RIFF WAV PCM.

But there are a few which don't.

I'm guessing they are some kind of ADPCM but even then I'm not sure which one IMA/MS.

Can someone take a look and provide a solution to this?

Here are 3 files which don't playback.

As it turns out, VGMstream can already play these files by renaming them .xwav

Although, I can't seem to find a file similar to a soundbanksinfo.xml file or a .txt file that identifies each wav file's ID string and provides its corrosponding file name.
