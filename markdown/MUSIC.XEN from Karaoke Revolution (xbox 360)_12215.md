Hi guys! 

Can you help me, please?:) Is it possible to extract audio from music.xen files of Karaoke Revolution 2009 (xbox 360).

404.

I'd like to know how to do this too.  Rather than just linking an extracted file, can you share how you managed to do it, please?  

--Edit--

OK, it doesn't 404 anymore.  I'd still like to know how it's done so I can extract all the songs and not just one.  Thanks
