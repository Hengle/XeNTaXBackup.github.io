Model by LucasArts. Needs work. Done all I can do. Max 2011 file rigged with biped. I am very new and not very good, sorry.

well done, but how did you rig the bones did you make them yourself or are they from the game?

Could you tell us how did you extract it from the game and convert to a usable model format?
I'd really love to know that, pretty please?

@lark   - Actually, it is a cheesy biped rig in Max.

@panzah -  Well, I did it the ubernoob way using 3d Ripper Dx. But now I have used the tfu_gto_converter to convert them directly into obj format. Search for the post regarding tfu_gto and you should have all you need. Brilliant , these people are here.

Thank you very much for this.
I thought the TFU model converter never got past that broken Max script.
Now I know about TFU_GTO_Ripper life became so much easier.

People here indeed are great, thanks to everyone putting their hard work and precious time into making things like this happen.

Mimic? Legit? Read? Above?

And is anyone looking for any rigged SW characters? In Max? With a sh!tty biped? I have several. I have no formal training and had never even heard of Max or even seen a CAD app before last December and had never actually done anything in Max until June so what I have is not great, but I do not think that there is anything worse than what I posted above. I cannot release everything, as a few people are using what I have done in some upcoming fan films and such, and asked me to hold off for a little while.  But if you request, I may have available.
