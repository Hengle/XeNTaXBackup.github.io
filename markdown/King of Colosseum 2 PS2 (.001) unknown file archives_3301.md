- Post Title: King of Colosseum 2 PS2 (.001) unknown file archives

Hey guys, long time lurker first time poster.

So basically I've been attempting to unpack the texture files for the amazing PS2 title King of Colosseum 2 in order to re texture many of the games characters.
The games textures are organised in two individual files:

KC2FIRE.000
KC2FIRE.001

I've successfully accessed the textures in the first file using Game Graphic Studio. It's allowed me to modify the games menus and character selection screen. All the images are in the TM2 or TIM2 format which can also be found in the WWE Smackdown games.

Where I need your help is in accessing the second file. When loaded in Game Graphic Studio, it simply crashes. It isn't supported by the MultiEX commander nor does it work in Game Extractor or Dragon Unpacker.

Does anybody have any information on the .001 file extension and importantly how to open it?
