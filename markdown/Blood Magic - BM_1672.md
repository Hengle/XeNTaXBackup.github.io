Yeah this is the blood magic game that I put in the "help me with the decompression" thread - but use the snippet in the other thread cause you need a much larger cut to grab the full directory.

Yes, the problem is that the files are compressed - we realise this but we have been unable to determine the compression used for these archives, so at the moment you will not be able to use any of the compressed files.
