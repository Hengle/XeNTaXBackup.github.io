- Post Title: Extracting 3D Models From Call of Duty: Finest Hour (Xbox)

Hi everyone, very new to ripping models and extracting from games. So far in trying to extract 3D models from this game, I am using Game Extractor program from wasso. I extracted the files from the games .iso and have opened COD.pak and it seems to be filled with a bunch of unnamed .dds and .pcx, anybody know where to go from here?
