I am currently trying to make a custom 3D model for a mod in Minecraft 1.7.10. I am using IChuns Tabula, from popular recommendation, but am having no success. I cannot find anywhere on the internet a guide on how to turn the exported java class, and .png into a functional model. There are several videos out there, but they all have gaps, or have unnecessary things added for the mods they are displaying, and as such are very confusing. Does anyone know how to make custom 3D models, and would be willing to help?
