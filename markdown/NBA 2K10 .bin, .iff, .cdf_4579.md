NBA 2K10 and it excellent models.

[](http://i076.radikal.ru/1006/bd/aca1b4a0f35e.jpg) [](http://s55.radikal.ru/i149/1006/1c/a080f0eb0935.jpg)

Game folder files list attached below.
I very interested in converting models, weight data and textures from this game (and similar-engine game to).

Game file extension:
CDF - some kind of storage for IFF files (95 files, 512mb)
IFF - scripts, textures, model data (3747 files, 3.9gb)
BNK - animaudio00X.bnk, where X is number from 0 to 7 (8 files, 5.44mb)
BIN -  archive, i don't know for what (31 files, 1.88gb)

Ok. In details:

There is 90 IFF files with name:

pchead_XX.iff
pchead_XX_hb.iff

where XX is number form 00 to 44. I think it's model of heads. [Here](http://www.sendspace.com/file/jwuvc3) some of them.
Also near of 'pchead' have files:

pcface.cdf (3 431kb) [download](http://www.sendspace.com/file/6ayl85)
pcface.iff (1kb)
pcface_lo.cdf (46 297kb)
pcface_lo.iff (4kb)
pcfacehair.cdf (31 984kb)
pcfacehair.iff (25kb)
pchair.cdf (5 063kb)
pchair.iff (2kb)

and

pcmorphs.cdf (23 547kb)  maybe face morph settings for chunk of head (pchead).
pcmorphs.iff (4kb)

Next we have XdornaXXX.iff name-like files. [In this post](http://forums.nba-live.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&p=995673&start=0#p1087207) answer what is this, but i don't understand what is this actually. Anyway [here](http://www.sendspace.com/file/5zta51) the samples.

There many pngXXX.iff (894pc, textures) and coachXXX.iff (157pc, for models and textures of coaches i think) files, where XXX is number. [PNG samples](http://www.sendspace.com/file/obhpp2). [COACH samples](http://www.sendspace.com/file/j92g1i).

[Here](http://www.sendspace.com/file/obhpp2) samples of other files. With the name like r1h020.iff or s550_lo.iff.

Also have files:

paplayers.bin (80 360kb) [download](http://www.sendspace.com/file/w8hl3h)
pcchest.cdf (3 825kb) [download](http://www.sendspace.com/file/qgdbaq)
pcchest.iff (1kb) [download](http://www.sendspace.com/file/8ambnw)
players.bin (80 145kb) [download](http://www.sendspace.com/file/0hkcpn)

So will be nice convert this game files in dds/png/tga and dae/smd/fbx.

Hey Tosky, I would like to help you out again, but can I make a small request, can you upload some mascot models preferably a feline or a bear? This would be very most appreciated.

Why you don't wrote about files contains text from this game, I just try to find text editor for this game and for now I can't find it yet. Maybe any of you have one or can make one?

Hey, Tosky, the files are compressed with a compression algorithm similar to EA's compression used in their game Spore and the Sims: [http://www.simswiki.info/wiki.php?title ... ource_Code](http://www.simswiki.info/wiki.php?title=DBPF/Source_Code)

I hope someone can figure it out some I can get my grubby paws on a mascot model...

It's interesting news. Thanks  
I find tool called NBA 2K10 Cyber Faces Converter [here](http://www.moddingway.com/news/517.html). It support converting heads into blender. [Latest ver](http://www.sendspace.com/file/ovy88i). Maybe it help.

I'd still be careful visiting the website without a firewall on. Any ways, the tool on the website works, and it has a decompress function in it, how ever it only works on the .iff files, however the author is working on other types of files like the bin files.  The current tool also has a blender importer and exporter.  I assume that the game, itself will load both compressed and uncompressed files.
