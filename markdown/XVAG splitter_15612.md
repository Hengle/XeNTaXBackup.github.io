- Post Title: XVAG splitter

This tool will automatically split XVAG files found in such games as "god of war" into individual MP3 files.

Just drop xvag file onto the tool.

Tool may fail on some rare files. Sorry, I have no time to investigate this. In this case, just rename such file to MP3 and it should work.
