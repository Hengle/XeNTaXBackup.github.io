- Post Title: What is a .ONE?

I'm searching around inside a cracked Wii game, trying to find the geometry for the environments/landscapes and I'm finding files with the extension .ONE. Is this a type of geometry format? If so, does anybody know of a program I could download that would read it? The other format I'm finding is .TD, is *this* what I'm actually looking for? If so, what will read it?
