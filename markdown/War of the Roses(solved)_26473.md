- Post Title: War of the Roses(solved)

hi. friends.

Does anyone have any info on War of the roses?
The bundle file of Bitsquid or stingray engine game War of the roses was extracted using the bitsquid_unp tool.

Internal files consist of .unit , .texture , .material , .level files.

Texture files can be viewed by simply changing the extension to dds.
A .unit file is like a model file.

The search relates to 3DS Max Interactive or 3ds max stingray.
Maya bis importer is provided in the sdk, which is a modding tool for Warhammer: Vermintide 2, a game with the same engine.

sample here.
