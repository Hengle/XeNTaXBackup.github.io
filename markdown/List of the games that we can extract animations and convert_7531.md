You do realise how big that list could be don't you?? there a millions of games out in the world and MANY can have the anims ripped.
If you want lots of animation try a google search for things like BVH, Mocap , or better look for the "carnegie mellon motion capture" its a set of animations ( about 1000 of them ) everything from walking, picking things up to disco dancing ( including some michael jackson moves ) Who needs to rip game animation when Mocap is already a huge business and ready for use.

Guy, to complain is not polite. If there's something that I've learned is that somethings let it linger to come...

In my specific chase, I need specific animations, from specific games - Fighting Games. My specific project lies in to make a 3D version of Mugen.

Great! 
But how? 
What tool(s) do I have to use? 
Does this(ese) tool(s) work also with emulated games (From Arcade [MAME], for example)?

I'll thank for answers.

you bumped a very old topic... but since it's already bumped here's my answer:
there are few games to my knowledge that animations can be extracted currently. Just search "animation" in the forum and you'll see how few results you get. I think it's hard to bother doing since it's not as easy as vertices/skeleton.

to add to the list:
Resident Evil Darkside Chronicles (wii)
Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles (wii)

The .brres format is very well documented as well many tools (I used brress viewer by kentilan, can be exported to md5anim and psa/psk). Probably a lot of wii games using that format can give animations too.

Oh, sorry by the inconvnience, and thanks for the hint. 
But, there are few fighting games to Wii (Castlevania Judgement is the only one I remember).
If ripping animations is very difficult, isn't there another way? For example, I've seen (In Youtube) people that play with MikuMikuDance using animations from the demo of Virtua Fighter 2. Did they copy the animations frame by frame?   

I'll check your hint, thanks again.

Well, first of all, to adapt an animation to another skeleton that it was created for required a lot of tweaking and a serious amount of time for many reasons, and usually the results are mediocre at best. 
So, you need to adapt the ripped skeleton + animation to your fighter models, which requires for you to do the weighting which is time consuming as well and requires skill to get good results.

I don't know if you have experience in rigging and animation or if you're willing to spend time learning. If this is your first attempt to make a game my advice would be to start small. Forget about Mugen and get some random characters interacting with the animations/models/skeletons you could rip first. I can help you with that, drop me a pm. 
Check this post also for another tool for extracting animations/models/skeletons. [viewtopic.php?f=33&t=7901](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=7901)

and yes, there are many methods to get animations besides ripping (which again, mainly serves only for that character only). You can do rotoscopy (copy frame by frame over a video), motion capture (there are cheap devices that can work with kinect also). But at the end, if you want to get good results, it always requires an animator to tweak everything.

Could you possibly do the deer hunters animation from Timesplitters Future Perfect.
