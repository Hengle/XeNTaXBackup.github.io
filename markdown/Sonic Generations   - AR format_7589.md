- Post Title: Sonic Generations   - AR format

Hey yo!
I succesfully extracted AR files in sonic generations using quickbms (GUI version).
(AR segs archives script)

But when i try to repack it, it says 

```
- open input file I:\dmsx-sgsg\disk\bb3_out\Languages\English\aactioncommon\dsf- open script C:\DOCUME~2\user\LOCALS~1\Temp\InternalScript.bms
- set output folder I:\dmsx-sgsg\disk\bb3_out\Languages\English\aactioncommon\SonicActionCommonHud.ar

  offset   filesize   filename
------------------------------

Error: incomplete input file number 0, can't read 4 bytes.
       anyway don't worry, it's possible that the BMS script has been written
       to exit in this way if it's reached the end of the archive so check it
       or contact its author or verify that all the files have been extracted


Note that if both the scripts and your files are correct then it's possible
that the script needs a newer version of QuickBMS, in which case download it:

```


What should i do, how to repack it?
