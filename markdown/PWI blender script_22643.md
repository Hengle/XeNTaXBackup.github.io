Hi,

there is no blender script available. 

But we got Noesis script  [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=21311&start=60](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=21311&start=60)
and 3d studio max script [viewtopic.php?t=11776&start=15](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=11776&start=15)

You just need to export from noesis to collada or from 3dstudio max to whatever format is importable in blender.
