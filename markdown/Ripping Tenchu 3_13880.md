- Post Title: Ripping Tenchu 3

Hi. Maybe this question has already been posted, anyway, i wonder if (and how) could be extracted models from Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven. I've always wanted the models from that game, becouse it had some.. Quite unique characters. If that game it would be for wii obviously i could use Dolphin emu with 3dx ripper. But it's only for ps2 & xbox. The 3dx ripper with epsx2 doesn't work good. So, there is maybe someone who had been succesful or has any idea?
