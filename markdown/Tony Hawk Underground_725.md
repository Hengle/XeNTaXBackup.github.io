any chance of getting adding support for T.H.U.G.'s .PRX files ? need to be able to add/replace files already in them. i attached one of them as well as an image file that maybe someone can tell what image format it is.

Well, i have examined them quickly, it seems it can be done, but I have little time at the moment.

is there anything i can do to assist? i am VERY familiar with these files and have been working with them for quite a while. i have an unpacker(preRIP) which was made for tony hawk's pro skater 3's prx files, it unpacks thug2's prx files if if i edit each header slightly. the tool does not repack the files, which is the most important. if i can do anything at all to assist please let me know, thank you for taking time to look into it. -M

Okay, so these files are compressed right, does anyone also already know the compression method?

Ok this thread is over six years old but i wonder if anyone ever extracted anything from Project 8? I've always loved the environment/world in that game and would love to get it into max and have a play. As its not an unreal based game I have no idea where i'd start (i'm a modeler with no coding knowledge). Are there any tools out there similar to those used for RE5 extraction?
