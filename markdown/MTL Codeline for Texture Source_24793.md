- Post Title: MTL Codeline for Texture Source

I have a Question, dont know if i am right here. So,  If i extract Game files i have the 3d Model files (for this example Obj) and the Texture Files (PNG or anything). The OBJ put also an MTL file out, that give the obj the information to find the right texture, for example:

newtl shader_0
map_Kd example.png

newtl shader_1
map_Kd example1.png

My Problem is that the obj and mtl files are not in the same Folders is like the texture (png) is. When i want put them togehter in 3d Modeling Programm like  Maya or Blender i have to copy them in the same folder, that means a lot of copying and mouseclicking when i work with many Files. Exist there a simple codeline i can write in the mtl file via Editor to get the source folder for the texture when i open it in maya or blender??
Sry for my bad english its not my motherlanguage.
