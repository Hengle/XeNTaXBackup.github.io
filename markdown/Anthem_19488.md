Hey everyone,

I was wondering if there might be some sort of tool out there to rip from the Frostbite3 engine.
And if not what other way could I go about ripping models from Anthem?
Would Ninjaripper work or would I perhaps need some specialist tools?
Seeing I still have the public demo installed I thought I’d give it a go once I’m home in a few days but just wondering if anyone else has tried or had any succes as of yet.

Game is NOT even officially out yet, Demo was available I get it, most of us have it, and starting today Pre-loaded if you pre-ordered it, but be patient.
Also your here for so long I am sure you already noticed by now that Frostbite 3 games as well as older ones can be already extracted and what not.

Oh I totally understand.
But seeing the demo had been released and some people might have had a go at it already I thought it’s better to ask and see if anyone could point me in the right direction in any way shape or form.
I saw the thread on the Frostbite engine, but honestly it seemed a little over my head in complexity so I thought that instead of posting there if anyone could explain it to me, I’d ask in a seperate thread (thus not derailling the intial one).
But is there a big difference when using the new frostbite engine in comparisson with the older ones? Because I remember with the IDtech engines it was a big problem from going from id tech 3 to idtech 4 with all the mipmap issues and such.

I’d love to get more hands on with this but have no idea on where or how to start.

I also found out that facebook has an in camera app which adds an anthem armor on top of someone, as in an interactive armor not just a statick image.
Is there any way we could rip from that? They might be low poly but it might be something?

All I have learnt so far is that, Anthem has a completely new format, nothing currently existing will extract the game, it will take some time until something will surface, but according to history it will, when, time will tell as always.
We just have to be patient.

Currently there's no tool/script that can convert the audios of the game via the EBX binary assets that are linked to the actual audio chunk data, it can only be dumped/extracted.
I mean, if you know the header of the audio you can look through the chunks data and actually are able to play them via vgmstream/foobar2000 combo, but there's just no official way to extract the audios in their folder structure with names to know what is what.
