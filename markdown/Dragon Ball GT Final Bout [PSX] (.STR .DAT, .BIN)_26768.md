I searched the web for the formats and it looks like the STR are not audio files and do not know how to dump the .STR and .DAT files, some samples: [https://mega.nz/file/xH4xmbbS#HZ1wsSiaJ ... egFPIPR1sM](https://mega.nz/file/xH4xmbbS#HZ1wsSiaJcMEillSmvliHa2X-Jjn7CDy6egFPIPR1sM) thanks!

STR files are PS1 video files [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/STR_Video](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/STR_Video)
You can use tools from the wiki to play and edit them.

DAT and BIN files are probably a custom binaries.
