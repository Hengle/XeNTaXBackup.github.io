- Post Title: WRC 7 .P3D character models

I know there's already a thread discussing about them before, but this time I'd like to rip the character models off this game. There's already a blender script for the game as linked below but it was made for Blender 2.49 and I couldn't for the life of me get it to work even on that same version unlike before.

Here's the blender script:

And here are the character models in question:

Really, dunno how many dozens times I've posted it:

You'll need to copy the newGameLib directory into the blender_2.49 directory to make the script work under Windows 7 and higher.
(If you need more than  one dir for other scripts expand the dir name. You'll have to change the name in the script then, too.)

I see, let me give this thing another shot then.

Well, as I wrote, this works with Windows 7.

Just checked it with Windows 10 and, puuh, got an error (missing module zipfile).

Probably you'll need to install python 2.6.2.

(For a quick test I copied 201 .py files from the Python26\lib folder to blender-2.49b-win32\newGameLib_WRC7\myLibraries 
under Windows 10 and it worked.)
