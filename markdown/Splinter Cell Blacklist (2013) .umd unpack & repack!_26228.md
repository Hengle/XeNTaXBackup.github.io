- Post Title: Splinter Cell Blacklist (2013) .umd unpack & repack!

Hi, 
I'm trying to translate Splinter Cell Blacklist (2013)  and edit font in game. 
This tool works perfectly for unpacking & repacking the .umd file. the problem is the file I use to edit font has crashed, it's unpack & repack with no error (from pic) but Game still crashes. (dynamicwin.umd >>fonts_int&gfxfontlib.gfx)
Does anyone have a solution to this issue? appreciate you helping me.

original file & my file : [https://www.dropbox.com/s/sf2e3t57xtem0 ... d.rar?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sf2e3t57xtem01u/dynamicflash.umd.rar?dl=0)

Unpack attached file to a folder and put the tools there: aluigi's quickbms and offzip, Gildor's unumd.

For loc umd:
Drag it to !export_loc. Files unpacked to loc-... folder. Edit them, but size can't be bigger than original, or reimport not work.
Drag it to !import_loc for reimport.

For ingame text: (they are in ...strm_b.umd files)
Drag umd to !export_text. The xml files size can't be bigger than original, or reimport not work.
Drag umd to !import_text for reimport.
thanks for this worked
