First of all try to find the files that contain Model3D data, maybe it will be compressed or not, packaged on a larger or not.
After that it will be a good idea to post an example of Model3D to see how it can be exported

the good news is it's a unity game and I can confirm that Unity studio can extract models and textures form the game. I know cause I've litterally done it.  the bad news is you aren't likely to find the 3d models in the basic download. see AVP evolution has two parts. the .apk file and the .obb files. the .obb is where the actual 3d models are. so you must make sure you have the data not just the apk.  

 most sites that help with apk distripution will have a seperate link for the data. I know cause I was working with an emulator and had to install the game manually. the models are decent over all. but don't expect high poly models out of it cause you won't get that. the files are useable over all but not entirely much to look at.

 anyways if you can't get to the files you want the pm me and we can talk about what you want out of the game and I'll send them to you. hope this helps.

I was able to unpack the game files, myself, finally.

So far only the images and textures, the models so far only in .obj, since I need to find models files with bones.
