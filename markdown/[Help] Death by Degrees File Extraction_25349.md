- Post Title: [Help] Death by Degrees File Extraction

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHXpxNRuSo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcHXpxNRuSo)

I did it myself by watching this video and following along.

I used Quickbms' death by degrees.bms file to extract obj and other files.

I used blender or 3ds max, but I can't read the file.

There is no error message either.

Which program is the problem?

My english is bad sorry
