- Post Title: Ninja Ripper and front end games

Yo,

Im having trouble using Ninja Ripper on a steam game called "Tiger Knight : Empire War"

It has a frontend.exe which i point Ninja ripper to, this is like a windows mode main screen ( like league of legends)

There is a way to preview your models in this frontend, but the Rip i got came out flat.

When you start an actual match, it launches kingdom_64.exe,
I tried restarting ninja ripper and opening that, but i obviously get an error because you cant just launch that program from your desktop.

Any ideas on how to rip from this game?
