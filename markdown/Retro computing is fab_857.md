Check out my latest system: 

A Philips MSX2 (128K Video, 128K Ram, 64K Rom), NMS8250. I used to own an MSX (1 en 2) back in the day when I was 12.   

I just wanted it back! Got myself a bunch of original Konami cartidges as well! Brilliant! Nemesis, Maze of Galious, Vampire Killer and others! 

On the picture you see I started a game of King's Valley...You just gotta love that game! 

I already own two Commodore 64's, one Commodore 128D (BOXED!) and a Commodore Amiga 500. 

Now I want an MSX-1 (Philips, VG8020), Commodore VIC-20 (my first computer ever, 3.5K Ram!!!, numerous of times I was coding some program in BASIC, only halfway through: "?Out of memory error"   ) and a ZX Spectrum (the first one, 48K, and a more 'modern' model, ZX Spectrum 2B).

hmmm I only have 4 c- 64 with two of them broken down to use as spare parts (hehe). Anyway, of the recent compus I still have an old 286 which you could put from 20MHz to 8MHz, although it sounds utterly stupid to reduce the clocking speed of any computer, it was very very crucial upon playing a lame version of pacman on the pc (). Running Pacman of 20MHz was impossible as the ghosts would overtake any person in 0.000001 seconds (only superman skills would save the pacman at this level   ).
I would like to meet the person who surivived one level at 20 MHz (haha).

Yeah before they discovered how to use timing .  Just imagine meeting someone who could play it at 3000+Mhz

Lol, ghosts moving at light speed, haha. 

"PUSH BUTTON TO START" - *click* - "GAME OVER" hehe

I also have a C64 that I lifted out of his box, and had attached to my PC at some point (the internal print). I could just plug in its keyboard (on the print) when I needed it. I had a videocard that could handle TV in, so I could view the running C64 on my monitor, while I still had all the functionality of my PC. If you want to use the SID chip (the c64's sound chip), and you don't have one of those custum made cards (with a SID on 'em), you just have to be creative huh, if you want to compose some tunes

Right, so Paus gives me the VIC20 AND 20 euro   

Well, you just decide what you want to do. Look around on [http://www.marktplaats.nl](http://www.marktplaats.nl) for prices, or ebay for worldwide prices. 

I saw one being sold for 15 euro, but that had also some games and stuff added to the package.

Here we go with the pictures of my beloved VIC20 (anno 1982).   



The front side of the original box. 

"Met kleur en muziek!" (With colour and music)   



The back side of the box. 

"An expandable computer system" which was literally (and therefore grammatically unstable) translated to Dutch: "Een met uitbreidingsmogelijkheden computer systeem".   


The trusty VIC20 itself! Notice the nice colours, emphasizing the Colour Computer.   


The whole set-up, with original tapedeck. Did you know the VIC only had one joystick port? Now you do.  

Check out that TV screen as well, notice how it has 22 columns. Imagine going through a listing showing in lines that have 22 characters per line. Luckily that it had only 3.5 BASIC KRam standard. I got it with an 16K expansion cartridge though...THAT'S LIKE 6 times MORE MAN!!!!!!

My list of computers as of today:

- 2 commodore 64s (64K) in good shape (old and new model), 
- 1 broken commodore 64 print (fixable)
- 1 MSX2 NSM8250 128KRam, 128 KVideoRam, dual drive (3.5), 256 colours
- 1 Commodore Amiga 500 (expanded to 1 MB)
- 1 Commodore 128D (built-in diskdrive), 128K, in original box
- 1 Commodore VIC20, 3.5 KRam, in original box
- 1 Sinclair ZX Spectrum (48K, issue 2), broken (trying to fix, blown transistors and regulators)
- 1 IBM compatible, AMD 2600+, Geforce FX 5600, Sound Blaster Audigy 24-bit

Plus a truck load of peripherals, such as diskdrives, taperecorders, joysticks, books, cartridges and tape/disk software. 

 

If you have any computers that are either broken or in good shape, I can use them. Especially sinclair computers at the moment.

Wow that's really impressive man. Too bad none of these systems will run Half-Life 2 decently 

Or maybe you can hook them all together to create some kind of Frankenstein computer.

You bastard!   Eyeing that Megaplex, I got interested in the game again. I fired it up around 11:30 pm, just to see if I remember what this was all about, though I was tired and really had to catch some sleep.

Hahaha. Yes, that's TTD.

Sooo, how far did you get? Got any screenshots?

And did you have: [http://www.ttdpatch.net/](http://www.ttdpatch.net/)
Some very important fixes in that for the original.

And when all else fails, there's [http://sourceforge.net/projects/openttd](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openttd) which works great!

No, not yet. I have been #$#$@# at the computer again, because of FOOLISH trains, that decide the shortest way to a destination is to take a completely different track that, granted, will get them in the GENERAL direction of their destination, BUT NEVER TO IT. Had to build intermittent stations to get them to take the right track, or force them to take it by adjusting the signals, but that just sucked and interfered with my MASTERPLAN. 
There's nothing as irritating as a train that takes the wrong track and then get's himself stuck inbetween signals.

That's part of the fun! Nothing is more satisfying than cleaning up those things, creating waypoints for dumb trains, and watching the finished self-sustaining system work.

Right now I'm waiting for maglevs to arrive so I can build the true megaplex, a network that will span at least half the map.

By the way, I haven't really experimented with openTTD much, but maybe the AI is better in that one. I know for a fact that the NPC AI is much better in openTTD.

Hmm, it's not the real thing though. Anyway, these stupid NPCs interfered with my masterplan as well, building a BLOODY station right next to my - unconnected - one. I was building the track to it, but these FOOLS build their station next to it, and their TRACK right in front of my exit lanes, goddamn son of a bitch! So, I had to contain it, by buying land all around his track, before he could finish it. it's good to see him "crawl" his way to his destination, only to be surrouned by "SOLD" signs. Hahahaha.

What the hell?

> GS: The RollerCoaster Tycoon series is known not only for its family-friendly gameplay, but also for just how easy it is to pick up and play. Will Locomotion be as accessible? How are you making sure that the game has enough depth while making sure it isn't too complicated?
>
> 
>
> CS: I think that, if anything, Locomotion will be simpler to play than Transport Tycoon. Over the years I've learned that adding complexity doesn't necessarily mean a game is more fun to play. Of course some people like complexity, but most people just want to have fun. In many ways, playing Locomotion will only need similar skills to playing RollerCoaster Tycoon: If you can master roller coaster construction in RollerCoaster Tycoon, then you'll be adept at building transport routes in Locomotion. The depth of the new game comes from the interaction with the landscape and the activities of competing companies. There's always something interesting going on in the game, and much of what goes on depends on how you play the game.

Oh great. They want it to be stupid-people-friendly

Okay I bought it. First impression is pretty bad. Railroads take up a huge amount of space, and the signal system doesn't look too sophisticated. It looks like they stripped some of the complexity that made TTD so much fun. I haven't really played any of the larger levels yet though.

Graphics are also pretty disappointing. Lots of jagged edges due to landscaping, and you can't really have a neat double-sided railroad. Junctions take up much more space than before. You run out of space quickly. The railroad's curves are better now though.

Now I own a issue 1 ZX (16K) and two issue 2 48 K (one working).

Wow, so ya all have room for those old computers? This summer I threw away my first PC which I bought in 1985 at the computer shop in Groningen, Telec. It was a 8086 with 256kb and two 5" floppy-disks cased in a metal box wheighting about 20kg's. 

The gemae I must enjoyed on my amber monochrome monitor was Gato, a 3d submarine game. Unfortunatly I don't have the space anymore to set the lot up so at present there are 2 PC's left out of four. And still I can't play Blood which mega sucks.

But not everything is retro: my IBM compatible has got fairly recent components, and only yesterday I bought a Gameboy Advance SP.

C64 - Lords of Midnight, Pirates! and Elite
MSX - Knightmare, Ping Pong, Metal Gear

Lol, I recently bought a C64 for fun (now I have four or something). A nice old model. I wanted to get the C64 Programmers Reference Guide, and now I have one (it was sold with the c64).

Oh I recently acquired an original version of Lords of Midnight.

OMG this is so awesome. I've got my MMC Replay and RR-Net add on. Now I have one of my c64s hooked to my own LAN and can transfer whole disks in 35 seconds from my PC (and back). Full client compatibility. I can even run my own C64 Webserver if I wish!
