Hey, I had another quick question about models from this game. The characters seem to have skeletal data towards the bottom of the model, and I was wondering how I would go about extracting this. There's also animation data which I'd like to check out if possible, but if not, I'd at least like to know how the skeletons work in these files.

Here's a few:
