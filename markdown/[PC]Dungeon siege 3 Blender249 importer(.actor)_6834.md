You have to unpack the .oaf files to get the .actor ones.

  File "C:\Users\Maxi\AppData\Local\Temp\Rar$DI56.928\import-dungeon-siege-3-201

    print mat.name
              ^ (This arrow is pointing at the "t" of mat, might be displayed differently in the forum view)
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Yeah, I know this is an old thread. I'm wondering is anyone would be able to work on a script/plugin that supports bones and bone weights. The available tools work perfectly fine except they were never updated for skeletons. I'd be happy to upload anything of use to getting this done. Here is a screen of the various files used by the game. 

EDIT: Instead of bumping to say thanks I'll just edit it in here. 

Big thank you to  Szkaradek123 for the update. Little surprised that the game uses facemorphing (I assume) as opposed to bones. Either way, looking forward to getting to sitting down and messing around with the models.

Hi everyone
I used Szkaradek's program (of course with Blender 249 and python 2.6.6) and created character folder with model of sword, but after select actor file in theprogram's window, in the python window is written:
count opf files: 0

Are you have some ideas?

edit: i know, what was bad. I thought, that actor files were good enough...
