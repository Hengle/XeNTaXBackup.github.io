- Post Title: Checkmark for guaranteed SR = WR

So a lot of the times I'll see someone claim WR when it's just the best time on this website. I was wondering if it's a possibility to add a Checkmark as a guarantee that every site record is actually a World Record as well.

I reckon this can be added to most popular games, and would easily clear up which games aren't fully on the site, or if they just have a small community.

To verify the checkmarks it should probably be a request by the mod team of a game, verified by the staff of this website. At least, that's just a guess of how this can be done I suppose

I think you have the wrong website. We have nothing to do with speedrunning here.

OP, what the fuck are you talking about. You are making no sense at all.
