- Post Title: F-Zero GX Audio Files Within Bin Files

Hello y'all. I'd like to extract the F-Zero GX SFX, however they're in bin files. Using the debugger we're able to listen to the SFX, but we can not truly extract or inject new ones. Within the bin files the audio files are very likely using AHX or ADX compression, which we can extract, but those bin files containing the SFX are really stopping us. Any advice will be welcomed.

We can only help if you post sample bin files.

I see, here is a link to the bin files: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/c4kk36mr ... e.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/c4kk36mry20qopc/normal_se.zip/file)
