- Post Title: Noesis Indexing Bug

I have written a script using mariokart64n's tutorial on how to make an import script for noesis. But when I run it I get an error that says "Undesirable object type at index 0 in list". I have done everything I could, including: rereading my script, uninstalling python, getting an older version of noesis, but nothing has worked. Can someone please help me, I am completely stumped on what to do. Here is a link to the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUpvM5Rv_Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUpvM5Rv_Y)
