I politely asked, (as I wanted to port some PS2 content back to the pc version) and it got implemented.

(Also, if you actually took the time to do pattern analysis in zdir.bin, you can see a 3 32-bit types defining some type of data)

If anyone's curious
- .wav output are videos, still trying to figure out what codec to use for the audio stream.
- If it's not .dat output files, it's most likely text. (Some exceptions)
- Audio uses PS2 .vag format. (Something I'm looking up)
- Includes geometry.bin and texture.bin files, though it's off-setted to a certain degree. (And all pre-existing NFS Mod tools don't work cause offsets are in different places)
- text files. (I don't know what there's a file talking about track markers, but it's there)
- CharactersA.bin ACTUALLY HAS DATA. (So The same 0kb file in the PC version of NFS:Underground is leftover material)

Any progress on this? Would love to be able to play the PS2 exclusive tracks on the PC version. I've been trying to extract the ZZDATA without any luck. I saw the post you linked but I'm still confused about how it works.
