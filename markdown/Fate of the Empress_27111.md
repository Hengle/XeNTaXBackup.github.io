- Post Title: Fate of the Empress

Game: Fate of the Empress ([site](https://fswqg.9917.com/main.html))

Here is modified AssetStudio with partial support for the game bundles ([link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QEGljiQMn05aGWuWbEpqUqlYx78ZYtGS/view?usp=sharing)). You need to split pkg containers into separate asset bundles first - it can be done with attached script, which also works for audio package and other different games with the same format.
