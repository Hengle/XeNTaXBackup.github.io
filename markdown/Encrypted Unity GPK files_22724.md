- Post Title: Encrypted Unity GPK files?

I’m trying to rip the music from School Days HQ and they come in files called GPK. I installed a GPK extractor and to my surprise, it’s encrypted. Does anyone know how to bypass Unity GPK encryption?

This comes with lots of additional features to make your life easier, such as the ability to edit and save archives for certain games. How about the ability to preview many image and audio formats without leaving the program, or displaying thumbnails of all images in an archive so you can quickly find the files you want to extract.
