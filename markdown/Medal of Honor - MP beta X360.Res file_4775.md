- Post Title: Medal of Honor - MP beta X360.Res file

I have a res file here from the beta MP version of MoH from the xbox360, I am having trouble trying to unpack the .res file with ea multi xma.

I tried offset 30 and 24 and none of them work, I am pretty sure this is a ea xma stream because of the FC01 flag.

Can someone take a look at this? thanks
