- Post Title: Yulgang 2 - Game Localization

I want to make the game my own language and hope to get your help. 
Does anyone know how to edit * .xpart files? 
This is a link to the sample file. [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-3GF86 ... p=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-3GF86lx4n9oXITQQ5uXMq1k3l4UW9W9/view?usp=drivesdk)

I have one more question. I have thousands of * .lua files. What can I do to quickly translate Korean into Chinese? 
My word-by-word translation is really too slow.This is a link to the sample fileï¼Œ[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Lzt-y ... p=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Lzt-yWxVglVS-EqbPlM1GdZyVCofZsx/view?usp=drivesdk)
