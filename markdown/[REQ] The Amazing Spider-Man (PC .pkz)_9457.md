Game is available in russia for quite some time as retail. Steam version is coming soon aswell.
Nearly all game data comes in .pkz files. They are not plain zips. They have some zlib compression on them.
Audio and shaders come in uncompressed .dat files.

I would provide a small .pkz and .dat file via PM.

Yeah, these seems a bit different from the Console version, I hope someone can look into this for the PC rather than Consoles.
