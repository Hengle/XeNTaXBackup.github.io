There are tutorials for this all over the place.  Just like I say on my own forums, why beat a dead horse, when it can be found ALL over the internet.  But anyway, just click on this link and you will get more than enough info on the subject.

I would also be leery of people that post a direct link to a program, instead of a home page of a reputable place that carries software to do what you want.
