- Post Title: Freedom Wars - EAF archive

I need help extracting from this game called Freedom Wars. There was a dude who wrote a script a while ago but the link no longer works and I do not hold a copy of the script. I am hoping that a kinded hearted brave solve would be willing to help me write a script to allow me to extract the files.

that is the file I want to extract.

This and other psvita files are not so popular so resources are scarce, so I will be counting on folks here!

It looks encrypted compared to old EAF archive.
It should start with "#EAF" signature, but your sample doesn't have that.
Here is header structure [https://github.com/CPkmn/Justice/blob/m ... ice/EAF.cs](https://github.com/CPkmn/Justice/blob/master/Justice/EAF.cs)

Someone needs to find a way to decrypt it.

Thanks to you I remembered that the files must be extracted while they are decrypted on the psvita system!
And I was able to decrypt it.

Much much thanks. For those who are reading and are stuck like I was, I used street fighter x tekken bms script located on the bms site.
