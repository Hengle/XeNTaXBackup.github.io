I have decoded awb acb file from CPK but it crashing decoding to HCA

of course, I have experience about convert other games acb awb files to WAV.

Here is sample awb acb.

awb acb files header is fine(header is UTF and AFS2), but it decoding to HCA, it crashing header stating "ÈÃÁ" 

anyone help this?
