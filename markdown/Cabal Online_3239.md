- Post Title: Cabal Online

Hi guys!

Started playing Cabal Online again and i am still after many years compelled by the animations and models. I wish that someone with the skills could take a look at the formats and see what you find.

I looked at the folders and there is a object/character folder with these extensions:

.ebm
.ech
.efx

I have included samples of these in the rar here.

1.8Mb rar file

I really hope someone can get something going here

Tried running the file through a couple of extractors and dragon unpacker found some .669 audio files. Here is an image from the unpacker. Maybe it gives some clues to unlocking this baby?
