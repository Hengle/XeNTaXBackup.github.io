- Post Title: .CVM files on PS2 Sonic's games

How to edit the .ELF file in the PS2 version so that the offsets are read correctly in the assembled new create .CVM archive and the game does not crash?

I encountered this problem when I edited their .CVM archives in Sonic Heroes, Shadow The Hedgehog and in Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity. This is a kind of ISO archive, only with its own title.
What tools I just didnâ€™t use, and DkZ Studio, and just rebuild the .CVM archive using Xpert 2.0, and in Apache - the result is the same - the games crash as soon as the main menus appear.
If at least one file in this archive exceeds the original, the game crashes. After reading various forums, I rather ran into a similar problem that the user described on the example of Persona 3 on PS2.
Can you help with the problem? Can anyone write a script or tool for the games mentioned above?

I attach the original files from 3 games:
