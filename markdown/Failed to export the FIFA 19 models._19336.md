This is your third topic based on same game and same crap, STOP wondering around and creating useless topics, stick to one.

And your issue is a known one already the way game is encrypted and Frosty ONLY imports the game, it does NOT allow anything else to happen, go to the Frosty Discord channel and solve your issue there, making multiple topics its counterproductive, seriously?
