- Post Title: Request: Rumble Roses models PS2

hi all,
I was reading an old thread about the rumble roses extraction tool and PAC files.  It seems that those links to the files have since gone down.  I am hoping to extract the Reiko model into 3ds max (with textures of course) for use in a small video project.

Might anyone help me with this?  Actually what would be even more convenient is if you have the model itself that you wouldn't mind sharing.

My email is [mussash9@yahoo.com](mailto:mussash9@yahoo.com)
I appreciate it!

why do you want the ps2 models when the 360 models are available?

I concur, since the Xbox 360 models are bad enough, I can only imagine how bad the PS2 version models would be.

well, call me old fashion but I sometimes prefer lower-poly models.  in my movie project it would help keep things smooth (because my laptop is a bit slow)... plus I like their look a bit better.

but if they are not available, then the 360 models would do as well.
where are they available, by the way?

And... I'm curious why you think they are bad.  When the ps2 game first came out, the models were very good for their time.  But I think in the 360 version they really sacrificed beauty and even realism for detail so they could show off the 360's capabilities.
