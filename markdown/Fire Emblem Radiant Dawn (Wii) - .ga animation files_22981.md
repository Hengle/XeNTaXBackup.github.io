- Post Title: Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn (Wii) - .ga animation files

[http://www.mediafire.com/file/4k82fur6v ... L.zip/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/4k82fur6v88jy4n/micL.zip/file)
The .pak files has the .ga animation files within it.

The .pak files can be extracted with the [Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn wii noesis .pak plugin.](https://github.com/Zheneq/Noesis-Plugins)
The .cmp file has the model files and it requires the use of gbalzss in order to decompress it: gbalzss.exe d [filename.cmp] [newfilename.pak]

zheneq's unfinished .ga animation code draft: [https://pastebin.com/XST2Nfwd](https://pastebin.com/XST2Nfwd)

EDIT: Renamed thread and changed the description of the post, thank you zheneq for finding it out the stuff for the .pak and .cmp file formats.
