- Post Title: A clothing fitting model program

How would you write a 3D modeler that allows you to load up a model (based on certain specifications), add some clothing (also based on certain specs), and then adjust the model's size and have the clothing automatically adjust itself to fit the model for "perfect size"?

For example, you might make the model fatter or skinnier, bigger bust or ass, etc.

Yes. Holy crap, that would make clothing mods so much easier for your games lol

Have you worked with something like that before?
Would be cool if we were able to write export plugins to the format they use....and export the stuff back out (maybe just another import plugin on our side lol)

This program is very interesting. There are several videos with tutorials on the website of "Marvelous Designer 2 (http://www.MarvelousDesigner.com)" that teach how to use their own "3d models" as an avatar within the program to create garments directly on it, animate it etc..., import and export any 3D model for this program or 3dmax or Maya in format ".obj". It is the best program to create clothing for characters.

Downloaded the free trial and gave it a shot.
Imports dae models and managed to load up a custom avatar.
However it looks like I need to set it up because its pose is different from what the program provides.

Guess it isn't as easy as I hoped LOL

Yes, it really is necessary to set the pose avatar within the program. It's a bit laborious but rewarding in the end.  I still do not know if it accepts import. "DAE" files. I need to study more about it. It's quite fun to create things in it.

When I hit shift+G (or something) some green boxes show up around the default avatar.
I'm guessing the program uses this to determine where the body is. Is there an easy way to fit a custom avatar, like if they had their arms straight out in a T-pose rather than 45 degrees?

In this video tutorial explains how to import an avatar from 3dmax for the program. Maybe it can answer your question. I still do not know how to use it completely. Hope that helps.
