- Post Title: [PSX] TIM Tool Converter

Tim Tool 1.0

This program converts various formats of tim and bmp. It supports the following TIM formats:

- 4/8bit TIM with only 1 clut
- 4/8bit TIM with multi-clut
- 4bit TIM with multi-clut & multi-image (2 color font)
- 16bit TIM
- 16bit TIM with mask image
- 24bit TIM

inside the archive there is a tutorial for the various file formats

[in the next update I will insert the editor of colors clut for 4 and 8bit images]

Thanks for the tool. 

Let's not forget that we already have a topic for TIM programs [viewtopic.php?p=167879#p167879](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=167879#p167879)
Keep that in mind while developing other tools.

Does this tool have any unique features that were not available in the tools created in the past?

Is there any chance that you would upload source code as well?

at the moment I have no plans to publish the source code ...
A feature that I have not found in other tools is the management of tim files with different clut and images inside, for example font files that contain various images with different letters and different clut
