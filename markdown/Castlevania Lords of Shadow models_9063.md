The original thread is too old and has been heavily edited by mods, it's barely understandable now.
Can someone help me in getting models/textures (possibly anims and music as well) from the Lords of Shadow game and the DLC?

if you want i still have all of the models from the game (no DLC) on my computer
i could send you a link,but you'll need 3D Object Converter to open the .sm3 files
anyway i don't remember much but it was just a matter of extracting the iso i think

no problem   , if you change your mind let me know.
anyway since i don't have the game anymore (PS3 ver) i took a look at the old thread trying to remember how i did it
i think i extracted the iso with noesis then used a bms script here [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5102](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5102)
and then all you need is 3D Object Converter.
