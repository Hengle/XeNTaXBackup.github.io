- Post Title: PS2 INITIAL D TUNING PARTS RIPPING

I am in PS2 Initial D game
I want to extract the texture and sprite of the tuning part.
But each failed.
I do not know where the data is.
Will someone convert the data of the tuning parts below to me with JPG?

AE86 LEVIN (A COURSE) WHEEL
RPS13 SILEIGHTY (A COURSE) WHEEL
RPS13 180SX (A COURSE) WHEEL
S13 SILVIA K'a (A COURSE) WHEEL

I want to extract these data.
