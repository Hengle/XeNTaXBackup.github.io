- Post Title: Valkyria Chronicles 2 game files extraction

Hi, I've been trying to access the game files of VC2 (to get at the tank models and such) and I've managed to get into the iso and have the game files, but they seem to be all inaccessible...
I also found a .CPK file that has half of the game's data but as well as the .bin files are inaccessible

It wont let me upload an example of one of the .bin files or the CPK because of size.. 

If anyone can help me with my problem I'd be much obliged

EDIT: I got the VC2 copy from Emuparadise [https://www.emuparadise.me/PSP_ISOs/Val ... pe)/158620](https://www.emuparadise.me/PSP_ISOs/Valkyria_Chronicles_II_%28Europe%29/158620)

Thanks for the links but I have further problems with this...


the CPK extractors you've linked me haven't got proper instructions and idk how to use them since everytime I try to launch them all they do is open cmd and do nothing (I've moved the cpk in question into its folder, outside and everywhere but it wont work...)


EDIT: Oof nvm found out how to work it atleast, now I just need to know how to access the 3d model files using Blender (I have the VC model importer plugin which handles MXE, MLX, ABR which are the standard VC encryption stuff but its not working for me right now since clearly the encryption system is different since the plugin can't handle them)

EDIT: The plugin I use is [https://github.com/gomtuu/import_valkyria](https://github.com/gomtuu/import_valkyria)

I think that working plugin for Valkyria Chronicles 2 models may not exist.

You can put a request here [viewforum.php?f=16](http://forum.xentax.com/viewforum.php?f=16) and maybe someone will create it.
You can also ask for additional VC2 support on github page you linked.
