Hey guys, I found these textures inside the files of Just Dance 3 (Xbox 360) and it's using AnvilNext engine, which uses .forge files for compressing it's data. With a help of a friend, I managed to extract the textures from the forge files and I'm stuck and I can't get the real textures from the files that are in the zip, which is attached below. Someone told me that they are swizzled and they need to be un-swizzled with Noesis's API. Please helğ, I got 1457 textures that I want to convert all together. I would be really really greatful if someone made a Noesis script for these, I really need to extract these textures. They are important to me

here is Noesis python script to open your samples.

supports X360 tiled dxt1, dxt3, dxt5 and rgba32
your images are going to view as upside down in Noesis,
i didn't want to flip them and mess with the data.
you can do this yourself in image editing software.

i also included a bat file in the attachment for adding a .jd3 extension to your
extensionless samples for the sake of opening them with the Noesis python script.   
create a folder and put your samples in it and put the bat file in there too,
then click the bat file and it will add jd3 extension to the extensionless files.

I actually have a question. How did you extract a game that uses AnvilNext on Xbox 360? I have been trying currently to little avail. If you could help me out, I would appreciate it.
