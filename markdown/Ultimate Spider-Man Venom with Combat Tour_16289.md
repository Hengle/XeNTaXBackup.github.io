Use Hex editor to edit and export/import files, textures, models and other things...

Hey bro...  I dont know about 3d models...  And hopefully this packages is not compressed ind thats a good thing...  Try find 3d format for this engine...  Then find header of 3d file and search in hex editor
And if your game crashed...  You dont have change package size...  Even 1 bit!
What do you want to do exactly?
