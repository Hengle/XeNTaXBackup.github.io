Hi, Has anyone got info on how to extract the character models from this game? So far I was only able to use the PackFileManager v4.1 to extract/view the files. But even in this case I am not able to identify most of the character models (I can see some game assets in rigid_model_v2 but not able to see anything for say trolls, orcs etc). Any advice on the toills that can be used?

Cheers
