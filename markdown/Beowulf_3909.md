Hi, anyone took a look @ Beowulf game files ? ( not audio, cause i found on forum some unpackers for sound files ). The think is the game have only Audio files and the videos one, and there's a Yeti file on the main folder, but i can't upload it since it's 1.70gb   . The file it's Yeti.big. And it's only one of that kind

it's necessary to have at least the first 10 megabytes of the file.
if it uses the "Gear BigFile" format you could have luck using the following quickbms script:

I want to bump this old thread, recently I'm interested in Yeti engine (wanna make maxscript for models), so if someone is willing to help it would be awesome! I can provide any sample, just let me know. Thanks
