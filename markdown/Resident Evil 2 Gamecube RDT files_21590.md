Hi there;

I'm curious about RDT files on Resident Evil 2 Gamecube version. I can't found them on my first search. The folder "Rdu" just have some *.ADT files. One for each room just like rdt files. But ADT is compressed images right?

I'm lost for now.
I will go back to my reserach but if anyone knows about that I accept tips!

Best;

Hey there;

Recently I discovered something about RDTs files on Gamecube version. This ADT files are RDT + TIM compressed in one file called ROOM1010.ADT, for example.
I can extract this files just using ADTSuit or ADTTools. But I can't compress this files again to swap with original ADT in Gamecube ISO.

Someone worked with this?

How can I put RDT + TIM in just one file - or in other words - how can I compress this files in ADT container again?
