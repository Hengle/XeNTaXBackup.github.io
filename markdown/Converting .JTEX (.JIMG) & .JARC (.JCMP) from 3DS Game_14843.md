- Post Title: Converting .JTEX (.JIMG) & .JARC (.JCMP) from 3DS Game

I'm desirous to translate the mode select icon text for my own use to play the 3DS game One Piece Grand Battle X. But I'm having trouble opening the files to even view them let alone edit them. 

A lot of the files from the game are packed in .JARC container files that can be unpacked with this QuickBMS script: [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/others/jarc.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/others/jarc.bms)

But some of the files are labeled .jarc and can't be extracted because it seems they actually are a .JCMP (perhaps a compressed .JARC?)

I'm pretty sure that there might be menu images inside some of those, but I've been able to find other .JTEX files that actually seem to be .JIMG when looking in a hex editor. I tried using a [.jtex converter by Ploaj](http://www.vg-resource.com/thread-27606-post-596512.html#pid596512) but it doesn't work with them at all.

I'd appreciate anyone who felt like taking a look at [these example files](http://www.mediafire.com/download/auqb6ja03o471mm/Take_a_look.zip) for me.

I'd be happy to find any way to open these files, I'd be okay with a Noesis plugin too if that's easier.
