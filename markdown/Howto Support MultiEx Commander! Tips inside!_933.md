- Post Title: Howto: Support MultiEx Commander! Tips inside!

Dear user, 

If you really really really like MultiEx Commander, you may support us. As a return favour we will donate you a registration code for MultiEx Commander. But how? Here are some options!

1. Donating a little so we can maintain the website and keep up the work on the tool. We are also in the process of setting up a WIKI that will collect all the game archive formats we can master. 
Go to :
[http://multiex.xentax.com/donate/index.html](http://multiex.xentax.com/donate/index.html)


2. Send us 15 emailaddresses of news editors of game related sites (e.g. games in general, modding in general, or specific games) plus a reference to the actual site, so we can get into contact with them and know they exists. Send those to :

Please use "MULTIEX PRESS" in the subject line. 

3. Write scripts for MultiEx Commander, or give tips on how to add support for new games not yet supported, figuring out archive formats and so on. 
You can use our forums to help us. Also, when the WIKI is up and running, you can join the project there! 

4. Link to us from your own (fairly popular) game site and writing an article about MultiEx Commander. 

5. Any other way of cool support you can think of! 

Thanks VERY much, 

The XeNTaX Crew
