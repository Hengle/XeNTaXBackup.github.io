Hi there,

recently I bought THPS HD on Steam.
I'd like to extract the 14 songs of the sound track out of the game's data files.
There are 14 *.wem files (Wikipedia and other sources say that the game does have 14 tracks in its sound track) in SteamApps\common\Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD\THHDGame\CookedPCConsole with a size ranging from 23 to 36 MB per file.
Any ideas how to convert/extract them?
Here's one of the files for further examination.

Thanks!

Its Raw ADPCM. Just load into your favorite audio editor.

Thank you! 
I'll use Audacity to convert the music.
Are these values correct?
