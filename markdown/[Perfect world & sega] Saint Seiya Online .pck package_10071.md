- Post Title: [Perfect world & sega] Saint Seiya Online .pck package

hello, this is my first time posting here ...

I would like some help in extracting files from an archive of the game Saint Seiya Online produced by SEGA and the Perfect World. I already test several PCK extractors but it seems that none works in this new game

I already tried to learn how to create extractors in QuickBMS but not had much success, but at least I could understand something of the files that I tested. When I opened the Saint seiya files in hex ​​editor  my mind exploded. I could not understand anything.

if someone can help me or give me some light here is a sample file:

My real intention is to extract the models to make a costume using papercraft.

I do not know if using this file will be possible to create a decent extractor to the Models.pck file

if necessary use the models.pck file, the official link to download the game is this:

if no one can help thanks for your time ^^
