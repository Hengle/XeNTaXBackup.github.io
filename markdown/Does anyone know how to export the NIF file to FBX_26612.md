- Post Title: Does anyone know how to export the NIF file to FBX?

I'm trying to export this nif file : [https://www.sendspace.com/file/pbgci6](https://www.sendspace.com/file/pbgci6)
it containts : textures,mesh,armature and animations.
I tried blender plugin but that didn't worked for me.
I did some research and someone manage to export it in 2010/2011 but I never found an answer, could anyone help me figure this out?


Thanks, regards.
