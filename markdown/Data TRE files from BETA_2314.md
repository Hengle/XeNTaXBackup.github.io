- Post Title: Data TRE files from BETA

The BETA TRE files are uncooperative with 1.5.2 of SWGExplorer.  Anyone know of a tool or version of a tool that will open these BETA files?  I would gladly attatch one for your viewing pleasure, but the forum returns an error every time I try.  Anyone have an FTP I can upload to?

SWGExplorer will not open them, and InsideSWG just crashes. SWG TRE doesn't work either, and Xentax Tre Archiver actually curses me out for even trying!  (kidding)

Someone is requesting that a UI be extracted from them over here...  --> [http://mods.mandalorians.de/system/foru ... post_16023](http://mods.mandalorians.de/system/forum/viewthread.php?forum_id=6&thread_id=2372&pid=16023#post_16023)

Never mind, uploaded at the bottom of the link posted directly above.  Have fun.  [http://mods.mandalorians.de/system/foru ... file=16023](http://mods.mandalorians.de/system/forum/viewthread.php?forum_id=6&thread_id=2372&getfile=16023)

Guess that is a no!

Did a search for Beta TRE  and Data TRE and came up with other TRE related things for the current versions of SWG, but nothing from BETA.

I will keep trying, thanks anyway.

Hey, it's the holiday season. 

I think this stuff has already been discussed in other threads about TRE files.

You have a link, because search doesn't seem to be able to find anything on Data TRE files from BETA.

EDIT: Did a search again.  Lots of stuff about current publish, patches, people requesting help etc... but I was unable to turn up a single thread about BETA files.

On a hunch, it sounds like you did a Google search, right? Try searching with the [built-in search function](http://forum.xentax.com/search.php).

though it says Ultra-n00b under my name, I do know how to use built in search.  And I did.  I found NOTHING about BETA at all, that was of any help regarding the issue of opening BETA TRE files.  I am not trying to open current SWG TRE or TOC files, which is all the search pulled up.  I am trying to open TRE files from the BETA version of the game...

As I said in my second post...

BETA TRE results: And yes, I read EVERY SINGLE POST....
