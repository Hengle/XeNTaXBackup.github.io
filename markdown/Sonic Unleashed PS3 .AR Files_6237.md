script for quickbms valid for the majority of games of Arc System Works (the "segs" signature)

note that some of the extracted files are other archives and so you must unpack them too with the same script... yeah a bit boring but at the moment I don't have ideas for an automatized solution

the script can be used in reinjection mode so is not possible to use quickbms for the reimporting job.

you must write a repacker by yourself

I found some segs files that don't work with the script - maybe it needs an update?
