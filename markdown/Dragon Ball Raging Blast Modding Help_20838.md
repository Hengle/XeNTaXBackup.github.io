- Post Title: Dragon Ball Raging Blast Modding Help

I downloaded the plugin from revelation in noesis and i changed my xbox 360 afs files for the game into asfd in my file manager and i just extracted them and i recieved the spr,ioram and etc files that i need.. But when i try to view the models it says cant be previewed why is that? and is it possible for me to repack these files back into afs form?
