- Post Title: Encrypted MP3 file

I have download some games for Iphone. It is in .IPA format.. but it actually is a zip file. All you need to do is rename the extension to zip and you can open the files inside... However, I run into some problem. I located all the mp3 files of the game but cannot be played in regular players like WMP... It looks like it has been encrypted... Can someone help me out..

I have included some sample musics found in the IPA files...

Well at least, those *_s files contain a valid ID3v2 tag. Maybe they have somehow cut off the mp3 header?

I didn't check the file but some games have used changing the frequency value in frame headers to other than what the audio was encoded with making mp3 refuse to play
