Hi. I am looking to view/convert the .bwav, btga, .bmsh, .mrk, and lvl files for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone PS2/GameCube/Xbox but I am not having any luck so far. Any ideas are appreciated. Here are some samples. Thanks.

I've checked your samples.

BTGA is some kind of custom image container. File format looks like this:

```
{
   160 bytes - header
   x bytes - image data
   1024 bytes - palette data
}
```

You can try to get some results with TextureFinder.

BWAV is some compressed audio.

LVL is a text file. You can open it in Notepad++.

BMSH looks like some kind of model data?

MRK file is empty.

Hey thanks. For the bwav do you have any suggestions on how I can decompress it as I can't find anything that tells me how to so far? I did just try using TextureFinders but the colors don't display properly and I did change the quad and pixel formats but no luck.

Hi, BWAV files are compressed audio files.
There are multiple audio entries for each file, first one is always PlayStation 4-bit ADPCM, other ones are currently unknown.

To extract them you can create ".bwav.txth" file 
and put these lines inside:

```
start_offset = 0x44
channels = 1
sample_rate = 22050
num_samples = @0x30
```


Then you should put all your BWAV samples to the same directory.
Final result should look like this --> [https://imgur.com/a/HbIvOBH](https://imgur.com/a/HbIvOBH)

Then install foobar2000 with vgmstream plugin.
Now you can just drag and drop bwav files to foobar's window and play them.

Thank you so much! How did you manage to figure that out? When I researched I came up with nothing.

It's just a lot of knowledge and experience from researching other games on this forum
