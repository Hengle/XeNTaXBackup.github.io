Hello,

I'm not quite sure what you're asking. Do you want to know what software is pictured in that screenshot? Or what game the model is from?

I'm afraid I don't recognize the model (though there's some really intricate costume design going on there, it's lovely  )

However, judging by the user interface, I'd say that application is MilkShape 3D. It supports many different model file formats, and a trial version can be downloaded free-of-charge at [the author's Web site](http://chumbalum.swissquake.ch).

Hope this helps.

@alcexhim
kazhuki01 created duplicate threads for whatever reason, that model is apparently from Tantra Online PH: Genesis.
