Just a quick check and question. 

Did anyone successfully rip this game? There are some models of old school Star Ocean characters I'd really like to get my hands on

I managed to load the game on a rooted device and found what looks to be character files. I have no idea if it is correct or not. Will share them here in hopes that someone will be able to decode them.

Hope someone can help.

I already looked at these games I can't figure out the face data.
If you can get a 3d print screen of a model it might help with looking at the data.

... You can take a 3d print screen of an android app game...? 

How would you go about doing so?

*Edit. This game cannot be run in bluestack, so wasn't able to use that to get the print screen
