VGMstream has been modified to work for the Wii version only. bxaimc mentioned to me that he had to change the original header that the plugin uses for Eurocom ADPCM. But he doesn't want to change it anymore in case it starts adversely affecting the original Eurocom ADPCM header implemented in VGMstream.

I'm working on a full rip at the moment. I've got all the music files and the music from the cutscenes as well. I just need to upload it is all
