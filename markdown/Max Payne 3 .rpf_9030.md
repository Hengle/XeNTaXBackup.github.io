- Post Title: Max Payne 3 .rpf

The game is now offically out for a few days on the PC and for two weeks on the Xbox 360 so I thought I open a thread for it after the other one got locked for obvious reasons.
Nearly everything from the game comes in the .rpf file format, a new version from the format that was already used in GTA IV and RDR.
I know OpenIV is working on this but I haven't seen any news from them so far, maybe someone here got already some progress about this

Are there any .IMG archives on it, or just RAGE packages?

they used xbox360 files because it came out first. if pc came out at same time, no one will even bother with the console stuff.

you also cannot do any worthwhile modding on console. plus it requires a completely de-legalized console setup.

people who want to mod need to come to pc, otherwise deal with the restrictions of an inferior game system.

What the h.. u talking about here. From your words u dont have any idea mate. They used X360 files because they are not encrypted with key. And you are completely wrong, u can't modding anyfile whatever it is on PC or consoles systems ever. So your post is completely useless in this matter and entire not true. I dont care about modding as its such but i do localize the games to help people. First you should get the facts and then post such a thing in here. Why every morning must some people making me angry  If you dont like the consoles, it does not mean millions of others does.

the important files on the pc version(the rpf packages) are unencrypted. it also has better textures, performance and features as well(dx11, tessellation, etc). i'm not "hating" on consoles, i'm just explaining that it's not good for modding and not really that great for gaming as well.

modding for the pc is naturally the best option, if possible. people only mod for console because there is no pc version or they have to do their pointless translations.

Pointless translation??? Man u should really shut up, coz this will piss off many people include me. I'm not native english speaker and most ppl on this planet is not, so be very careful what you saing here and it also sounds very selfish from you.

Srsly, you don't have to explain people that the PC is better for modding but some users use consoles and some users have a real hard time understanding english and are happy about those translations, not everyone in the world understands english fluently. So there is a reason to have the ability to mod games on consoles, so stop with this nonsense and get back to topic please.

Yes it supports file replacing although there are restrictions on the console versions which means the rpf cannot increase in size so any new files cannot be bigger than the original. 

As for a release it is still quite buggy so it might not be for a while yet but when I decide to give a few more people access I will keep you in mind.

Well do not please restrict it on size if u replacing the file. You can use it on RGH or JTAG without any limitation(same as PC). As for some person who want to burn it or something can keep replacaed file with the same size, but please DONT put this restriction on it and make it posible to create even bigger archive(this is mandatory  ).


Thx

It's not so much a limitation of the disc but more of the actual archive structure, replacing a file that is bigger than the original would require the moving of every file after the replaced one so not to overwrite any data which is not a quick change. I plan on getting all the basic functionality of replacing files first then I'll deal with rebuilding whole archives.

"Consoles are not for modding. Honestly, you must take this." (This has been said to be a mercenary under orders from Rockstar)

straight from the horse's mouth. if you want mod, build a pc and play on pc. consoles are for children.(This has been discussed an idiot)
I assure you, I'm not a child. In fact, I have a son and the two played the console. Modified games console multiplayer spoiled but not many people use those modifications to take advantage simply use them to get a better gaming experience such as to have subtitles in your language as Rockstar, only translated into five languages

As Twisted explained before, any updates will be released over on his Blog, and only a certain amount of people I believe will be granted access to RPF Tool, View Only Beta (Not sure will need to speak to Twisted). There is still bugs which need to be fixed as has been explained above. So if nothing is posted from Twisted or me (When he is busy) then you just have to wait.


Perfection takes time, so RPF Tool will take time to improve & make better. I have a few updates for Twisted though which included models, and texture editing which will be included inside RPF Tool. But like I said please be patient. You will not be disapointed!

I'm not say anything about textures, I've say about RPF archives, and it able to full edit or create it.

unfortunately without being able to edit the texture and object drawable dictionaries, modding is very limited. here are some swaps. very buggy, and parts of model are missing.

snooki   



basically figured out how to get whole legs to show, but have to remove pants for most of these models since they all wear jeans.

if we can get texture edit, we can just alpha channel the parts of the pants we don't want. same with shirts.
