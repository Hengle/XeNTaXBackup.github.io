well, strictly speaking, yeah you can mod the models and textures if you have 3dsmax, blender, lightwave, photoshop, gimp, etc. The real problems are (a) recompressing everything back together into the proper format(which should be possible since the files can be extracted to some degree, although someone would have to write the code for doing so) and (b) the real big problem....would the game engine accept modified files? I've read that in sf4(and this is not verified just something I read) for example if you modify the model files at all the game engine will not accept them any longer because there is some form of validity check in place, however you can mod the textures all day and it doesn't care. Regardless of how true that is of sf4, you could easily run into the same sort of problem with t6. if the engine verifies the files at all(and it would seem logical that it would at some level or another) then your mods wouldn't work or at least would not work properly and may or may not glitch out the game in the process of mucking up. Moreover, trying to modify the game engine if this were the case would be a HUGE endeavor. Of course, the engine might not care at all, in which case your mods would work fine. But how often does that happen in life? lol! At any rate, just my personal opinion so take it with a grain of salt or two. Someone more knowledgeable may step in and correct me on my game theories....hehehe....but yes, the models and textures themselves can be modified just a question of if the game will take them after  the mods have been made.

Thanks for the info   so its just a matter of tools etc wonder if it would be possible to delete textures etc there are a few that are in the XEX as well i was trying to find where the character identifier was but might just mess around with the XEX.

Hey guy's. Same question about Tekken 5
Original iso emulated through PCSX2 almost nice but only on top CPU's ~3.5/4GHz
I have ~2Ghz & game runs 2 times slower or 8 times uglier to run it smooth. I know there is mokujin model that exist inside game, and i know there is a scene where nothing "loads" CPU as shown at picture. Scene working 30-40% faster

 

1 -empty model 2 - empty scene.

Which man able "to make things working" :)? Where to look right coder? Can it be done without realy big efforts/time/money? Like some secret code at logo "slow pc dummies on" = Ingame models are different color mokujins "slow pc emptyscene on" = scene is always empty endless bathroom regardless of what is selected on other screen.
I can share all necessary files, iso, misc. I think i can do some basic code manipulation if someone experienced show me the way. Please help :) Ty
