- Post Title: ARchive_neXT: Rainbow Six Siege Files Not Opening.

Hi there,
I am trying to rip the operator models from Rainbow Six Siege with ARchive_neXT, but when ever I try to open a file, I get a message saying "xxxx is not a compressed DATAFILE, and its contents are unknown. 

Would anyone know of a fix to this, or alternatively, a different program?

Thanks in advance!
