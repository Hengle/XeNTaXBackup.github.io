- Post Title: SWTOR modding (help?)

Hey all, don't know if anyone can help, but some years ago and when SWTOR modding/file ripping was still a thing, something called the SWTOR nude mod came about. I was wondering if anyone wanted to take a crack at fixing it or updating it, as there is an issue with the mod applying to males. The issue seems to be that one of the .gr2 works with female bodies but not the male ones.. Any help would be great

(willing to commission the fix too!)
