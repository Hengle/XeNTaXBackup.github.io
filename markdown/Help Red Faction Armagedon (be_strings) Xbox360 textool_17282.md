- Post Title: Help: Red Faction Armagedon (be_strings) Xbox360 textool

Hello xentaxers

I'm trying to translate Red Faction Guerrilla\Armagedon. 

The swuforce script ([https://www.zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=3544](https://www.zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=3544)) works perfectly in the PC version .le_strings files, however, on Xbox 360 the extension is be_strings, and the script above does not extract the texts so that I can edit them.

Is there any other way or tool so I can extract the texts?

Thanks for listening.
