I've spent the entire day doing nothing but translating D3DWindower into the glorious English language. It took quite a long time, but everything is finished. Please leave feedback here and let me know how I did! I will make updates if any serious bugs are found!

The same crap when you press alt enter in some games in fullscreen.

I'm surprised you've never heard of it! It's basically a way to window older games that typically do not have "Windowed Mode" support built in, which is why D3DWindower is awesome!

That's funny, I tried running NHL 2000 with it, and it didn't work, as the game still ran in fullscreen.
