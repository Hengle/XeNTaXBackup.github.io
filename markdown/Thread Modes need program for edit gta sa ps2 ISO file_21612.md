- Post Title: Thread Modes need program for edit gta sa ps2 ISO file

Hi I trying to mod this game for ps2 and I was almost successful
i dont now its right place for post this

I have no problems in convert txd file or add script file to game


But I'm having trouble adding files to the game ISO


I'm using apache3 & apache2 & apache1.1 and ultraISO To add and replace file and Extract file for edit. But use of these two programs sometimes fails and sometimes succeeds This means that the game sometimes crashes after replacing the files
gta3.img

gta3_1.img

main.scm

and etc
I'm looking for best program to edit this ISO without break it also for edit gta3.img and gta3_1.img I'm use Alci's IMG Editor 1.5 and crazy IMG - But this programs can sometimes corrupt ps2 img files. I'm also looking for a program for edit img file without break it too


(Im testing my edited game on pcsx2 , It's difficult to test games on the PlayStation 2 every time) But when i tested one of my moded gta sa on real ps2 console -scph 90004- after loading screen and start cutscene game frezze
but in my test on pcsx2 game run perefect


for now I'm success in add Fps counter and replace effect texture and some other texture and some other CLEO mod

if i found right program I have no problems anymore

There someone here who has the experience of MOD this game and can introduce me to the right programs
