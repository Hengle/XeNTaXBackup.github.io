- Post Title: Shin megami persona 4 models and buildings rip

Hi guys

I would love to grab the models and the buildings from the game (I have the PS2 disk), but I have no clue where to start from, nor if someone already did it.

Could someone please tell me how do I grab these and export them in fbx or obj? Even if the characters does not have bones is not a big deal, I can rig them, but I need them with textures.

For the buildings, I am looking at all the ones in the shipping district, and the house of the main protagonist, including interiors and textures.

Even better if someone has ripped them already, but I would like to learn how to do it thou.

Thanks in advance!

Much appreciated!

Now, if I open the DVD, I don't see any RMD files...there are a couple of big files called data.cvm, and zzzzzz.bin

Is there a step that has to be performed before that I can open the models? This is my first time 

Thanks!

Ok, I was able to get something done here:

First of all, you need a software called DKZ Studio; it is able to open the CVM files.

Once you get it, go in the model folder and grab from there what you need, and then export.

This gives me some RMD files, which can be loaded in the RMD Viewer. Then you export and you will get the OBJ file with the textures.

I've loaded it in 3dsmax and exported it as FBX, so far it seems OK; the only problems are the materials (which has parameters that are incorrect, so the render is basically plasticky shiny  ) and the faces that are not correctly oriented, which require to flip a bit of faces.

Not bad for 20 minutes of work...I just wish that they would look as nice as in the RMD viewer as soon as you export them

Changed the title, since I know how to do it now, and this may help others that are trying to get the models.

Keep in mind that you get no bones for the characters, and also that there are different version of the characters: one used for the dungeons and one used for the regular roaming. to me it seems that the dungeon version is more detailed, since you get close up during combat, but I didn't check the poly count for each.

Also I was not able to find the files related to the buildings...found some textures and messed up geometry but nothing more than that.

Avoid to rip it trough ps2 emulator; it is just a waste of time since the whole scene gets warped on Y axis, and you will waste a lot of time just to move it back to the correct size and orientation. Without mention the pain of having to flip tons of faces, since the normals points inward, in 50% of the model.

Anyway, I am happy that I was able to get at least the models; I will post if I have luck with the buildings, but so far I think it is faster if I just use a screenshot and try to make them on my own 

If you know where the buildings are, feel free to post a reply!
