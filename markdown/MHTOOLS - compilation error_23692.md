- Post Title: MHTOOLS - compilation error

Good morning, I was looking at the MHtools tool ([https://github.com/codestation/mhtools](https://github.com/codestation/mhtools)) and I don't know how to repackage some things within the game.
If I change the textures, how can I get them back to the ISO? what codes do I need? I know that the program comes with its tutorial but in this case to change textures I always get an error, can someone help me?
