- Post Title: I want reimport a CPK file. [PS3 GAME]

Hi everyone. Nice to meet you all.
I open this thread to ask for help with RPW_DATA.CPK file of dai-3-ji super robot taisen Z(PS3).

First I try unpack the cpk file to 0000000.xml as qucikbms with script 0.3a.


And some modified the file and try reimport xml. to cpk file, but it's not active with error message. 


Is there any script for quickbms to extract .CPK file from this .XML file? Please give me some advise for this problem.
