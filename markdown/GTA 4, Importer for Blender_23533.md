- Post Title: GTA 4, Importer for Blender?

Is there an importer script for GTA 4 in Blender? The only place I can find for converting this kind of model is ZModeler, but that is a paid program and I don't wanna pay for something right now. Also is there a tool for converting textures (that is free?)
