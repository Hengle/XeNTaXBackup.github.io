Yo!
Since new game is out I managed to get the bundle out of the .toc .sb files using QuickBMS script but now I'm stuck to get the 3d mesh from it.
The game does not work on WinXP so 3DRipper is not an option. Any help much appreciated.

bundles point to the chunk files I'm sure if they kept the same structure as the other frostbite games.

> Guys! Is it possible to get mesh using this method from NFS:Rivals since it's running on the same engine as BF4?I don't see any mesh data in your uploaded samples (but that does mean nothing  ).

Maybe you'll give us more details about the "structure of the other frostbite games" that cra0 spoke of?

Well I see it now more clearly, the game contains 8 .cas data files called "cas_0X.cas" which got weight a little over 1GB for each one
I need to say that I was wondering why those bundles are only over 100Kb. 
This is what we got in "data" folder:

And in"Win32":

Thanks for the answers guys!

you can use the Luigi auriela tool for extract the .sb file : [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/frostbite.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/frostbite.bms)
after you have this thing : [](http://abload.de/image.php?img=capturer6uv5.png)

I still don't understand how to extract/unpack audio files (Cop Speech) from Need For Speed: Rivals and convert them into a common audio files format such as .mp3 / .wav. 
Someone help me please!
