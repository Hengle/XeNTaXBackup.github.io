I readed the topic at the site that you (dj082502) posted here and the thing that i can't find is converter for the video files.

Downloaded the tools that 'Santos' (thx him for the tools) created for the game but there are no video editor or something like... video converter.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit: Holy.... 

The text can be opened with Notepad, Notepad++.

Cutted from the "ucs.pc" file ->

...
104965	Campaign
105040	START CAMPAIGN
105046	OPTIONS
105058	CREDITS
...

The only thing that now i need to do is to unpack the font file from the {ui_common.oppc} and draw the letters and the other things so the text can be readed in-game.

If anyone know how to convert the video files from .usm to .avi, .wmv, .mov... and convert them back to .usm, please, post
