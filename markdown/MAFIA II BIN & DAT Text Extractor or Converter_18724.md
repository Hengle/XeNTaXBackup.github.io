- Post Title: MAFIA II BIN & DAT Text Extractor or Converter???

Steam : [https://store.steampowered.com/app/50130/Mafia_II/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/50130/Mafia_II/)

Hey, guys. I managed to extract SDS data for Mafia II games, but I'm confused with the DAT & BIN files which contain text from the Mafia II game itself. Although the file can be opened using Notepad ++ ... I just want to have Tools Converter or Extractor / Importer for the file. In order to avoid damage to files.

Can anyone help me to find the Tools ???

This is for Files
