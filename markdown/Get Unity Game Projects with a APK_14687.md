- Post Title: Get Unity Game Projects with a APK

Hello guys!    

I am new here - sorry if its the false site to ask something like this.


I love Unity 3D and want to learn much more about the programming of Turn Based RPG-Systems. I tried to use Unity Studio to get the Project files of "Dragon Quest VIII" from the .assets-files. I only see some textures of the menu, fonts and Material-Files. Can someone help me?

I extracted the apk and also the .obb file (around 1 GB), but it don't work ._.

Thank u if you can help me!
