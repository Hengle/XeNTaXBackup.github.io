- Post Title: Extracting Star Wars Battlefront 2 .fbmod - Possible?

Hello!
I couldn't find any answers through search so i am trying my luck here with a new topic.

I am trying to port some SW:BF2 mods for other engines and i am currently stuck on trying to get the contents of .fbmod files.
I found a semi working quickbms script which gets some of the contents but sadly lacks filetypes for anything that's not just a plain png or jpg.

Is there any known or working way to extract fbmods for BF2?

Thank you very much in advance for your time!
