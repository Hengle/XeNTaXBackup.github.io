- Post Title: Questions for 3d models

why doesnt anyone just make a gpu debugger for the ps2 or ps3 or whatever game console your using to get the code for the vertex data and reverse engineer that code and see how the vertex data works i think this is a pretty good idea it saves i lot of hours looking for data

And does all the 3d model codes loaded in the gpu
