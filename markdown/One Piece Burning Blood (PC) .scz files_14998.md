- Post Title: One Piece Burning Blood (PC) .scz files

Hello everyone. I just got the new One Piece Burning Blood game for the pc today in hopes of extracting the models. In the games data folder are a bunch of .cpk files that I have extracted with quickbms and/or with noesis. When the extraction is done, it creates two folders called "npack" and "sound." In the npack folder are the extracted .scz files. Are the models in these files? If so, does anyone know how to extract the models from these files? I will leave an sample file where I believe one of the models are located in.
