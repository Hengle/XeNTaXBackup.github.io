- Post Title: Borderlands Pre-Sequel font WillBody (*.Texture2D)

Hello,
I wanted to edit font in Borderlands Pre Sequel. Using Gildor extractor, in Startup_LOC_INT.upk I found Font_Willowbody_18pt_PageB.Texture2D, but I have a problem with how to edit it.
using hxD I tried to deleting first 305 bytes, then 52 bytes from end [viewtopic.php?f=18&t=13771&p=114258&hil ... 2D#p115287](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=13771&p=114258&hilit=Texture2D#p115287). On my next step I added DDS header and changed file name of the file to Font_Willowbody_18pt_PageB.dds.

Now I don't know how to edit it properly, because after editing it and saving in paint.net, hexes are all messed up, so replacing them in HxD will not work. Photoshop can't open dds even using special plugins [http://fnordware.blogspot.com/2014/09/d ... s-and.html](http://fnordware.blogspot.com/2014/09/dds-plug-in-for-after-effects-and.html).

I'm sorry, I don't know if I've explained it clearly.

Here is the file.
