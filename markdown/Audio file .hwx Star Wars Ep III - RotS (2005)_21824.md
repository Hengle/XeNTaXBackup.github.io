- Post Title: Audio file .hwx Star Wars: Ep III - RotS (2005)

Hi, Again on this star wars game, I find absolutely nothing on the .hwx audio files, which is located in the game's .pak files. For the xbox version we therefore have the .hwx format and for the ps2 version the .hvg format
Well done in advance to the one who managed to open it   
.hwx (xbox): [https://www.mediafire.com/file/gxct2wyz ... 2.hwx/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/gxct2wyzwt3gtyr/drd_r2d2_headturn_02.hwx/file)

.hvg (ps2, if it is useful ...): [https://www.mediafire.com/file/aahwzgnj ... 2.hvg/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/aahwzgnjbwafpkg/drd_r2d2_headturn_02.hvg/file)

Try taking this up with HCS. They have more experience with audio.
