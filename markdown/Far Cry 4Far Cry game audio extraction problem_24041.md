- Post Title: Far Cry 4/Far Cry game audio extraction problem

I have extracted audio files from Far Cry 4's fat/dat files and most are .ogg but some are named broken with a name and are .ogx files. Is there a way to repair/convert/fix these files? They do not play and already tried using VLC, Audacity and Windows Media Player to repair/play them but nothing worked. 

I'm trying to get dialogue for the characters but it's hell since 15,000+ .ogg files that have no names and some are broken and no clue if they are actual voice files or just junk files.

Can you upload some OGX samples?

I finished going through the 15k+ files and can say for sure some dialogue audio files are missing for characters. If anyone can help me with the .ogx files I'd be greatful.

Sure thing!

Here are some links of the broken .ogx:

I set my sound to the lowest bit rate sampling and still nothing. I read this is a common problem in dolby but I have realtek. Drivers are up to date.

Thank you for trying, appreciate it. Maybe these broken files aren't anything? It's hard to tell since there's s a lot of files in the broken .ogx stat though so I'm unsure. Or maybe I'm extracting wrong, that could be possible. I use the dunia tools for extraction.
