I want to get a tool that can convert DAT and dfont to png.
So I can find several files I want from many DAT and dfont files.

to convert your samples to png is well … difficult as that files are no texture files … they are mesh files …. next time please also say from what game you rip that files  well its moonlight blade and if you had searched the Forum you would also be able to get at least 1 script that can read dfont files to a mesh…. here a mesh from your sample

These files are extracted from a game called "Ring of Elysium"，The Chinese name is "无限法则".The engine of this game is the same as “Tianya Mingyue”.
I have scripts to read DAT and dfont, but their names changed after importing 3D max. I don't know who they are.


After I imported all of them in 3D MAX, they overlapped in 3D max. Look at the following:

This is the overlap of three female roles.
I can't sort it out because three roles overlap.
So I want software to preview the DAT and dfont files directly, so I know which file belongs to the role I want.
To assemble a complete character model.
In fact, I extracted texture files, but these are three roles of texture files mixed together. I can't tell which of them belongs to the role I want.

Thank you!

I imported them one by one.But some parts overlap and I can't find the difference. For example, eyes overlap and you can't see any change outside.

I would really like to have a one-time import tool so that I don't have to repeat it more than a hundred times.

But unfortunately not.

So you Hit the Script.. Open a file and then use the Script again without cleaning what you imported before?

Yes.I use 3D MAX to open "dat" and "dfont" through the "Moonlight_Blade_DAT_DFONT" addons.
（“Moonlight_Blade_DAT_DFONT” [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XuWCHq ... p=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XuWCHqnWxQUD_S58HRLsYOMAXXtT6faJ/view?usp=drivesdk)）
After opening a file, I really didn't clean up what I had opened before.

But I found that not all "dfont" files can be opened by "Moonlight_Blade_DAT_DFONT" scripts.
Some "dfont" files can't be opened using "Moonlight_Blade_DAT_DFONT" script, I have a specific case. Maybe the author didn't update the script. after all, it is a script in 2016.


So I want to find Blander's dfont script，but so far it has not been found.
