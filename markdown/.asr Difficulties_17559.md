- Post Title: .asr Difficulties

If nobody can help me, than some higher-up should just delete my profile, because I only made it to ask this question.

I have a GameCube game ISO, and I want to rip multiple models from it for use in other things. The problem is, the 3D models are in .asr format, and I cannot find an application that can use these.
Does anybody have any application that can view .asr files, or am I just not doing something right, or anything else?

I would attach one of the models I want to view, so people who can help me with this can get an idea of what they're dealing with, but the website won't even allow .asr files apparently.

Just put in a .zip an attach it if its under 250KB I believe, if higher in size simply use another hosting service and post link in here.
The way you formulated the message though, well, no wonder many don't get help, its not the way to go, just saying.
Just pot the sample and you never know, as simple as that.

I'm just frustrated with this, because after a day of searching, I can't turn anything up.

maybe you're just searching for things (apps) that don't exist or never will come true?

It's always your own efforts that lead you to somewhere, or a point cloud at least:

I'm not that good with computers, so I'll be honest, I'm not completely sure what that is.

All I'm looking for is something that can either convert or view .asr model files.

Don't know if this could help, but I just thought of something while digging through the game files again.

I can't find any other files pertaining to the characters, except for those .asr model files.
So, what if .asr is an archive-based file of some type, with all relevant data for a single character packed into it?

I'm not sure, but it's the only thing I can think of at this point.

I made some progress by finding a copy of the Asura extractor, but I'm stuck again.
It's extracted multiple files from it, but I have no idea how to open any of them, and I only have some semblance of what a few of them are.
Again, I can't add them, because the site won't allow the file extensions, and the zip file is larger than the maximum file size.

The files I was given upon extraction were named "File00000" up to "File00008", and the extensions are: RSFL, RSCF, TEXT, TXFL, MTRL, HSKN, HMPT, HSBB, and a second RSCF.

I tried Noesis, as others have had success with it before, but it can't (or won't) open any of them, as well as a large group of its own files.
