- Post Title: Crysis3.xml for music.pak

I am sure that others have mastered extracting the music from music.pak already.

I am checking if the extracted files included a main Crysis3.xml for handling the music ingame.

If so, please attach and post. I already have access to the music through other channels, but not the xml file.

I remember Crysis 2 had this feature and it helped me identify the music in the 'fight' music folder.

Thanks in advance...
