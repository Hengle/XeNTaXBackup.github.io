Can anyone please help me with repacking game models? I extracted them with noesis, but i can seem to find a way to repack them. I am new to this site so i honestly didn't know where else to put this. Please help me repack the models.

your requests lacks of some more infos. Which game? which model format? which Noesis script?

(btw: I can't remember any "repacking" thread atm, so chances are pretty low, imho)

If so then your lost with your request, I guess.  
(only Revelation could help but long time no see...)

I don't know what you mean by script, but i know the neosis version is 4.204. The game is called dragon ball raging blast 2. The files are .spr, .ioram, and .vram. After i export those files they come in a .obj file. I need help repacking that .obj into those three files and that is where i need help. Here are some screen shots.
