- Post Title: SpinTires Truck File

Well, any know where i find a Truck file?

Have some .XML files and anothers without extension

This without extension file looks the Physics of the Model  and Materials, medium 890kb at 2,5MB, i think this can "construct the model"

i have no idea, any can help me? or have some tutorials for resource unknow models like this?

edit:

With hex editor i found this materials

```
	<Material
		MeshParts="wheel"
		Type="matte"
		DiffuseMap="wheels/aj8ckm6__d_a.tga"
		NormalMap="wheels/aj8ckl2__n.tga"
		SpecularMap="wheels/aj8ck55__s.tga"
		TwoSided="true"
	/>
	<Material
		MeshParts="mount"
		Type="matte"
		DiffuseMap="wheels/aj8ckm6__d_a.tga"
		NormalMap="wheels/aj8ckl2__n.tga"
		SpecularMap="wheels/aj8ck55__s.tga"
		TwoSided="true"
	/>
</CombineXMesh>
```


CombineXMesh is Direct X Files ".X" and cripted for Spintires
