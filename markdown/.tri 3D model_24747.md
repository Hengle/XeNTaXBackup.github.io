Hello forum! can someone open these files of one model, or help me with this. Please.

[https://mega.nz/folder/HXJxHKYZ#Mg1OOoadSTBivTh_naA7LQ](https://mega.nz/folder/HXJxHKYZ#Mg1OOoadSTBivTh_naA7LQ)

This is one of the parts of the complete car model from the Beetle Crazy Cup/Beetle Buggin'/Käfer Total.

1st part, for the next part I'll need some trick (again  ):
.
and 2nd part (little bit tired of "tricks"  )

(The "magic" is that I didn't really understand it, but worked.  )

Collecting vertices and face indices (FIs), as always. 
Did you try to get a point cloud? (simple part, using hex2obj, view link in my sig)

Details for getting FIs won't help you that much except you're a coder.

Edit:
Sorry forgot to explain what this is, this is my struct that I wrote in c++

I've included a 7-Zip containing the code::blocks project file which can be used to recompile the project if need be.
Unfortunately it's using some window libraries to handle i/o so it has a dependency on windows.h

The compiled binary should be in the project folder under ./bin/release/*.exe

You can either call it through command line such as <exe> <file.inf>, drag and drop, or simply double click the exe and hope for the best.

The inf and its daughter files are required to be in the same location and a new wavefront obj should be created in the same location.

It should be noted that I didn't understand the indices in the *.tri file so something probably isn't right :\

thank you so much, it works. true, not with all models, but the most important opens perfectly!

I have finished my Beetle Crazy Cup (Beetle Buggin'; Käfer Total) *.INF/VER/TRI loader module and I have released the following programs as web updates:

- 3D Object Converter v8.018	(Windows)
- i3DConverter v4.106		(macOS)
- i3DConverter v2.106		(Linux)

How to get the 3D Object Converter v8.018:
Download the 3D Object Converter from [ http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version.
After it just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the v8.018.

How to get the i3DConverter macOS v4.106:
Download the i3DConverter from [ http://www.i3dconverter.com](http://www.i3dconverter.com) and install it.

My program does not use the .nor file, but it checks the .inf file size (8 bytes).
Your sample .inf file has 12 bytes.

Unfortunately I have checked the cars folder's files only, your sample file comes from the track folder.

Just open the .inf file!

As I wrote I have released the  *.INF/VER/TRI loader module.

I don't know what .inf file did try to open, but the v8.018 supports the 8 bytes filesize only (currently).

This is the \Cars\356\1_CARRO.inf:

I have quietly opened models of cars, but there are no models of maps... sorry, I didn't notice that their size is more than 8 bytes.

Just use the Help/Check for updates… function to get the v8.019 version.
