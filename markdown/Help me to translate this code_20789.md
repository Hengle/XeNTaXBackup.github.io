Starts at line 358: render_allowedFPS
Have you tried to change "60" to just 60 at next line?
By the suspicious formatting of that block, it looks like you've been there already, since all numeric values don't have quotes, and are right next to the var name.
However allowed FPS doesn't mean, that it will actually run said framerate, it's limited by hardware, setting itself will only raise fps cap.

This looks like, it's base64 encoded.
There are plenty of base64 encoders/decoders online.
