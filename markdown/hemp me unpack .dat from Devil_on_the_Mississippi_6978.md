when I unpacked the game, run into trouble. There are no file size and offset in game's package index files , only the file name and directory. Please help me unpack. Attached is the first index file clips and tail fragments.

the SIZE table must exist for sure, if you search the bytes "88 02 00 00" (size of the first file) you must find them for sure or at least I hope :)
