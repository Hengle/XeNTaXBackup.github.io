Try using hex2obj. I was succesfull with extracting a .dff file from Deer Avenger 4 with it. It can export basically any 3d format.

in this special case using hex2obj would drive people nuts, I guess  
It's for simple formats and this special DFF format is not.

There's CH_francis_body2b_O_X in that file, so that's a start.
Some data structure  separated by FFs; might contain face indices.

You could create 3 H2O files from the following data:
copy 6 lines each into empty text files and name them whatever.H2O:
0x0 500
Vb1
12 99
0x2EAA2 111
020000
0x0 255

0x0 500
Vb1
12 99
0x2F002 35
020000
0x0 255

0x0 500
Vb1
12 99
0x2F1AB 26
020000
0x0 255

On import of the created obj files you'll get half of a sphere's point cloud.
