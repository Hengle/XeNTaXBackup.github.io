- Post Title: [PC] Star Wars Battlefront - Classic 2004 Animations and Rigged models

Hello, everyone! I've scoured around the internet for tools to convert the classic Star Wars Battlefront models and animations but to no avail. 
There's an old package called "BFBuilder" which has assets uncooked for mod makers, etc. 



The animations and models are stored in .msh files.
I've uploaded some samples here:
[https://mega.nz/file/QUYmgbDZ#fOseUAU-A ... d0Bjkh5H2g](https://mega.nz/file/QUYmgbDZ#fOseUAU-Ap_K46wIxnUl2b7aI5-Xub7J9d0Bjkh5H2g)

If anyone can help or at least point me in the right direction that'd be very much appreciated!! Thanks you for your time!  

If you require more animation or model samples please let me know.

The only things I could find are an addon for the now obsolete Autodesk SoftImage Mod Tool which imports both meshes and animations but it is impossible to export them to .FBX, .SMD or anything workable in the free version.
And the BFBuilder 3d model viewer, however it only exports .OBJ's.
