- Post Title: Zack & Wiki (Wii) - .arc Extraction

Hello, I've been trying to extract .arc files from a Wii game called Zack & Wiki: Quest for Barbaros's Treasure, however no matter which tool I used (ARC Tool, Arcman, rarcdump, yaz0dec, gcmdump) they ALL inmediatly close down. I've even tried downloading a previous version of Python (2.7) to run Arc Tool yet no results (And I've tried dragging the files to the python script too)

Can anybody point me out to a resource or tool to extract the .arc files or to fix the above issues?  (I'm almost positive they are images and I've tried to use Notepad++ but it's all pure gibberish)

I attach a link to the files in question, thanks a lot in advance.
