- Post Title: POP Forgotten sands

Hello, apologies if I am posting in the wrong, place, am new to the neighbourhood.
I'm trying to extract texture files from Prince of Persia forgotten sands PC version, currently I'm using Maki which shows the files as extensionless. Has a way been found to acsess these files or is there a converter/program?
