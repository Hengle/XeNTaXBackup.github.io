Simple enough, looking for a way to view the graphics and such. PAK file format, seems to be compressed.

Thanks for the response. I'll try the program you linked...as soon as that site comes back up. Been trying all morning to get at it. If there's a chance for a more reliable host site, I'd appreciate an upload. Thank you though, I'll keep trying otherwise.

EDIT: Finally got it to download. The extracted files are ".anb" extension. Any idea how to get those taken care of?
