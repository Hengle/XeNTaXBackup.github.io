Hello everyone, I knew in this forum.

I need the armor models from the Saint Seiya Senki for PS3 game, or the ones from the Chapter-Sanctuary and Hades for PS2.

But I have absolutely no idea how to extract them. I found this post:

[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5013](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5013)

Apparently there's a program called Noesis that can do it. But what do I need to do? Is this program freeware? Do I need any specific plugins? I have the Iso images, is that enough, or do I need something else?

Please help me guys, I'm really desperate, and be patient, I really newbie at this.

Yes it's free.

But to load the model you actually need the model files, which most likely will be packed in an archive which will probably be encrypted and/or compressed to make your life hard.

But maybe someone already wrote the unpacker.

I see, then I'll need the game disc. Gonna borrow it from my friend and make an Iso, then give it a shot.

But after some google, looks like noesis only opens the PS2 games, not the PS3 one. 

Anyway, I stucked until I get the disc image file, so I'll return when I get it

Thanks for you who helped so far

I'm back, I these are the news.

Got the game on the PC, and tried to open every single file in Noesis.

Some images, some .DAT files that could not be previewed, som DAT files that could be previewed, and such.

But there's one that caught my attention. 

It was called "resource.cpk". When I tried to open it in Noesis, the program said it couldn't be opened, but could be exported. After I exported, Tons of files appeared in a separate folder, like CHARA, SOUND, STAGE, CAMERA, and others. Exploring the CHARA, there were tons of folders with innitials of what could be the characters, like ATN for Athena, SEY for Seiya, etc. 

But none of the files in these folders could be opened in Noesis. The extensions were .2ry; .EMA; .EMB; . EMM; .EMO; .FBA; .FCM; .FDM and .FMA. Most were .EMA.

Now, what program open these files? Remembering, I'm trying to export the characters models for Pepakura

Thanks

News:

I managed to get the OBJ files. Does anyone have a tutorial for Pepakura?
Don't know if this is the right forum for asking this, but I don't know any other.

Thanks

Try [http://www.405th.com/forumdisplay.php/1 ... oard-Armor](http://www.405th.com/forumdisplay.php/14-Pepakura-and-Cardboard-Armor)


They have a tutorial for building the model after you print it out, but they probably would have one for importing object into the program.
