- Post Title: How to translate Unity games

Hello friends

Can you tell me if there is a new way to Import and Export Unity game files?
I was using UnityEX to translate games into my language, but it seems that the Unity engine has been updated, almost every game has applied this update. I am attaching a picture of a game file that I can't open.
