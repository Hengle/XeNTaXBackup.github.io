- Post Title: Rockman X Command Mission .arc file

So, i was undubbing MMX Command Mission and i found the file that changes the characters voices when they do an attack, is called "commone.arc", however, some tutorials don't give a good explanation on what should i do in order to extract and replace ONLY the audio files but leave files that alter text from the menus and such untouched and recompile the .arc file.
Can anyone help me out with this?

I put both ARC files in case someone knows what can be done with those.
Thank you so much.
