This looks very promising for unpacking. But it seems you didn't have attached all necessary files because these are some kind of index files only. They seem to be too short. Such files come often across within container files.
Please send a link for downloading the game.

I have looked at the game files. The only files which are worth unpacking are the .BIG-files. I didn't find any MGB-files. Are we talking about the same PC-game?
It exists an unpacker for .BIG-files called "GAUP" and is a plugin for TotalCmd.

I didn't find any MGB-files in the full game, sorry!

I am interested in extracting any container files (not least because of boasting about my little extractor program), but the small files you sent  I have no idea what to extract there...

If it is text then what is the use of extracting it if you can't reinsert it? I'd assume that is the point of this thread but it seems that asmxtx has the game but is not seeing what you are seeing. Not sure what to say here, are you SURE you are not confused or something?
