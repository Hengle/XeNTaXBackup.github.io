- Post Title: (PS2) Ghost Recon Jungle Storm .PAK

Hi all first post here, im looking for some help with 2 games.

first game, Ghost Recon Jungle Storm PS2. it appears all the data (.PAK files) is in the .IMG file, but i cant extract it. 

second game, Ghost Recon (1) Xbox (1) i made an iso of my disc and extracted it but im hung up on .GLB (globs ?) files that contain important textures. 

Im looking for any kind of ripkit, extractor or whatever program. if thats not possible then im looking for some kind of tutorial to make extracting these files possible. 

thanks!

update: i just managed to extract the IMG file. though i still need help with the GLB files and now a PAK extractor.

it appears these files are encrypted, is there a way to decrypt them?
