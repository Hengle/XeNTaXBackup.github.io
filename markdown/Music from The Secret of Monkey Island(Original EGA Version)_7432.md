- Post Title: Music from The Secret of Monkey Island(Original EGA Version)

Audio contains in SO blocks of .LEC archives. SO blocks are from two parts - first part have WA header(maybe this is a samples in wave-like form), and second have AD header(MIDI commands). As I know, the game support SoundBlaster, Adlib and Roland MT-32.

I try use SCUMMRev, but he dont support music from TSOMI, and another utils, which support it, I dont know.
