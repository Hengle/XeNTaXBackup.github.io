- Post Title: Harry Potter Kinect (.000/GEOM)

Hi all.

Was hoping someone could help with extracting models/textures from this game. The game is on the Xbox 360 and was made by Eurocom, and seems to use the same "GEOM" format they used in other games that contains models, textures, skeletons, and such. The game seems to store them in 000 files, along with a small .BIN file.

daemon1 made some tools for extracting models etc from the 007 games by the same company, those threads helped me understand more about it, but there are differences
with this game most likely since it's on a different console and other kind of game.

I've uploaded a sample from the demo version of the game's filelist.000 that contains the geom files. This should be the first two geom files, unless I cut it off incorrectly.

Also uploaded the entire filelist.000 from the demo, along with the small filelist.bin from the game files, but it's around 360MB, so I thought a smaller sample might be better to look at quickly.

Any assistance would be great. Thank you.

The links to the samples have expired, try to provide new sample files.
