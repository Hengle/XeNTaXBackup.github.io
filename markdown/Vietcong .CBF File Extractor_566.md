- Post Title: Vietcong .CBF File Extractor?

Hey, I was wondering if there is an extractor program which can extract files from the Vietcong Demo (CBF files) such as music and sounds etc

Thanks!

I have done something at least, and it will enable you to extract some files.
It's now well into 2004 and I apparently haven't still got round to get back to that CBF format .
