- Post Title: NFS Shift 2 U  .mrdf files decryption

Hi guys,
 I'd request for your help... Shift 1 was rather easy to mod with most of the files as an .XML...
In shift 2 they have worked on an format which made the game around 15% faster to load...(small improvement huh?)  okay they did taht and I have been trying to decrypt it on my own, but haven't got any success so far unfortunatly... 
the most important file so far is "physicstweaker.mrdf"  but there are other files in "physics related files" folder...     It'd jumpstart modding for that game, as it has quite miserable physics...

here are the files:  [http://www.mediafire.com/?o5k812eg90cmj64](http://www.mediafire.com/?o5k812eg90cmj64)


Best,
J
