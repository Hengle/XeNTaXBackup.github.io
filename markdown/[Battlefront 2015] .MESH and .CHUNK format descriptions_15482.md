- Post Title: [Battlefront 2015] .MESH and .CHUNK format descriptions?

Does anyone have a format description of the .MESH and/or .CHUNK files (or, a working importer) from extracted Battlefront archives? I'm attempting to write an importer all-in-one and I've been having trouble trying to create an importer based on the information I've found in the MAXScript someone wrote and the format info Wobble posted.

Any help or a point in the right direction is greatly appreciated. I'd be willing to post what code I have (C#, on GitHub) if it helps, but it's essentially a translation of the MAXScript that's being passed around.
