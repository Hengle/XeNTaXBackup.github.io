- Post Title: Unused Language Select in Gladiator:Road to Freedom Remix?

So a little context on how i found this.
I got nostalgic for the game Colosseum:Road to Freedom (PS2) and decided to checkout the Japanese exclusive remix release (it has new content) and decided to check if it was possible to port the english script to it by editing files (it is possible but it'll need work to shorten some lines)

I used expert tool with the ps2shinker to get the games files.The ones i've looked at for porting the script are DATA.RBB and GG.DAT with a simple hex editor you should be able to open them. While looking though DATA.RBB i found what appears to be a disabled Language select option (search for language and it'll bring you to it because it's only mentioned in that section of code) that appears to contain options for English and Japanese.
The GG.DAT file contains the full English and Japanese scripts. 
The Language option code it's both in DATA.RBB and GG.DAT among the rest of the main menu options.
I have not been able to get the language select to work
I have not found any talk about this in other forums so i thought that i'll let you guys know about this.

Hi SockMankey,

I know it's been a long time, but...

I am also a big fan of this game. Hunting down every possible edition of it. I have a normal one, released in 2004, I have a violent one (there is 3rd option besides blood and skins called gore) basically in the "gore" edition you can cut out the limbs of your opponents: legs, arms, heads ... pertty cool!!
I have a Japanese one called Gladiator: road to freedom remix. This one was released in 2005. It has more characters and customizable armors. But you probably know it already. 

But did you know, that... there is one more last edition of this game called: Gladiator: Road to freedom SPECIAL REMIX (or ERTAIN SPECIAL) released in 2006 only in Japan). It has even more characters and I believe more staff, as it is SPECIAL. I do not have this edition as of today. But I found on webshop used DVD. I bought it from Japan!! Now I am patiently waiting for it to be delivered 

As you can imagine, I also would like to dig into the scripts of this game and make a translation (or unlock it, as I assume, you found some interesting stuff inside game files. 

Would you be so kind and share for example what programs did you use to hack the game files of PS2? Any information would be appreciated. Thanks!

PS. Maybe we could team up regarding this?!

Hey man, I also have huge nostalgia for this game and played it when I was younger! Today, I installed an emulator and tried playing gladiator road to freedom remix, but the japanese is a bit jarring. Do you speak japanese? or have you just memorized where everything is? or is there a way to change the language which i don't know of? I'd appreciate an answer. Thanks!

Awesome to see people talk about this game in 2021!

Pretty sure the menu is handled in the executable. Also somewhere in the executable is where I've had the game load other localizations. Conveniently HASN'T worked with the Remix version. Though the Remix version definitely has English text that can be loaded, if you take Colosseum:Road to Freedom and overwrite everything but the executable it'll load the menus in English with the text from gg.dat. It'll crash after trying to navigate anywhere due to code differences.

Good news and bad news, you can edit the save on the memory card to set the language to english cause the language menu options were actually implemented into that. Bad news is that the memory card save/load prompts crash the game, I might try editing gg.dat to add/fix the strings and hope that it works.

I am glad to see that even in 2022 this game isn't dead. 
I have bought a Remix version game from Japan. It is not too hard to memorise the menu anyway but would be much better to be able to change the game language.

Hinki, thanks for trying out everything possible and impossible. 

I even was gonna write a letter to the Playstation, as they now have more and more PS2 games available on the PS4 platform. I don't mind paying extra just to be able to play this game on my PS4 full HD, or even PS5 upscaled to 4K. That would be cool!!

Good luck everybody and HAPPY NEW YEAR!! Tomorrow 2023!!

I don't remember but changing gore then comparing will show you where the settings are, you can cross reference with a different region to see the locale option

Sorry if this is a dumb question, 

But
Is there anyway possible to get the Gore option version ? I have been searching for years to absolutely no luck ? Can it be unlocked in the normal version through coding ? Does anybody have that version and is willing to share it ?

It's not dumb but my memory is also terrible so I have no clue. I assume it's in road to freedom remix if I was mentioning it in this thread but that's really all I can say

Can anyone confirm this? According to this: [http://redump.org/disc/76653/](http://redump.org/disc/76653/) - internal serial on SLPM-66577 (Ertain Special) is SLPM-66132 (Remix), which means it is pretty much the same version in a different box.
