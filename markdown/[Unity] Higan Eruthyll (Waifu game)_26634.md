- Post Title: [Unity] Higan: Eruthyll (Waifu game)

Hello, this game just came out on Google Play store and I can't seem to be able to load it's files into Asset Studio.
The error I'm getting is "...write bytes -1, but expected ***" (*** - different size based on the file).
I also, don't think the game files are encrypted, maybe it's a wrong header?

The game can be downloaded on Google Play.

Here are some sample .ab files:

EDIT: After exploring the files for a bit closer, I think they are encrypted in some sort of way.
