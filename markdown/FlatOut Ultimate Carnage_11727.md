- Post Title: FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage

Hi!
I'm trying to edit the strings in FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage, but i run into a problem.
I can edit the files, but i can't get it to work in the game.
My method:
1. unpack data.bfs to the "work" folder with BFSpack_V2.0
2. in work\data delete everything except language
3. edit the language0.dat file with FO2LangTool (it constatly says that it isn't a FO2 file, but it can open it without any problems)
4. packing, i don't know which folder should i pack, so i pack both
4a. pack the work folder with BFSpack_V2.0 to work.bfs
4b. pack the work\data folder with BFSpack_V2.0 to data2.bfs
5. add work.bfs and data2.bfs lines to the "filesystem" file

But the edited strings do not change. i also tried to add those 2 lines before the data.bfs line in the "filesystem" file, but it neihter worked.

If anyone would like to try here are the programs:
