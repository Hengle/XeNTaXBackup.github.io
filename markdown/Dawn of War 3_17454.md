Hi guys. I'm wondering if anybody knows how to extract the models from DoW3, I mean, I extracted the assets from its archives using cc2sga, but they're in a weird format that I don't know how to handle. Does anyone know if anybody came up with a tool or something to convert them? Or just what to do with .rgo, .rpb, .rgt...etc. I'm assuming that since you can't find the models anywhere on the Web, nobody has done this yet, seeing that the game is kind of a flop and all, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

Update: I succeeded in importing the models after all. I used Ninja Ripper, if anyone interested finds this thread and wants to know. Beware, you'll have to fix the textures yourself. Also, apparently, it doesn't extract the bones.

hi mate, which version of Ninja ripper are you using and what are the settings? I have tried various settings but no luck so far
