- Post Title: WITCHER 3 SAVE PROBLEM ON PC

played 2 hours of this Game today to then figure out You cant Not Save the game,

it installed the patches and everything, but when i go to manually SAVE GAME it pops up in this window and says " saves created with this version of the game will be incompatible with previous versions of the game" And my game WIll Not save NOR quick save. There isnt even a Game save file in my documents???  

What is the wrong with this game?
