- Post Title: Files inside NHL2K Games

I need help opening these files inside an NHL 2K Disk  (PS2 Era)

The problem is that 2K was nice enough to leave the files without a valid extension....

so the files just appear as "FILE" files.......

I tried to put the files in a HEX editor to find an extension but it is a major pain....I have been trying now for like 5 months to open them up...but to no avail....  

anyone ever come across a file with no extension? any help is greatly appreciated
