- Post Title: ACB files as uasset/uexp resources?

Some games under Unreal Engine 4-5 have awb files without acb's but first ones could be extracted without them (just not named by game data).

But I'm interesting could acb files as uasset/uexp resources and if so could be possible to extract them?

Games which could contain acb in such method:
Bravely Default II (PC, Switch)
Octopath Traveler (PC, Switch)
The Diofield Chronicle (PC, Switch)
Triangle Strategy (PC, Switch)

Found python script but he extracts awb files only - [https://github.com/maxwell-nc/Uexp2Awb](https://github.com/maxwell-nc/Uexp2Awb)
Example files from Octopath Traveller - [https://dropmefiles.com/aO7dC](https://dropmefiles.com/aO7dC)
