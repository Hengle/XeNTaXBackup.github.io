You can modify DDS files with PhotoShop using a plug made for that specific purpose.

DDS is a file format of DirectX, DirectDrawSurface or something, its mainly used by games and can contain stuff such as mipmaps and cubemaps, and stores pixels in direct draw compatible formats. The Texture Tool that ships with the DirectX SDK is probably the best tool for working with DDS-files.
