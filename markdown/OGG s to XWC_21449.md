Have you got a copy of the archive you can upload?  It might be a big file though!

here is the Waves_Streamed_Eng.xwc file... I want to export, edit and import ogg files, just to change the ingame voices and musics

I can help with your first question at least.  This QuickBMS script will extract the files with their proper filenames.

There is other stuff in the archive, such as lipsync data.  I can't tell the format of that.
