- Post Title: NCAA 14 PS3 sbr/sbs audio files

Does anyone know how to unpack/convert the sbr/sbs audio files from NCAA 14 on PS3?

Samples uploaded here:

I can't get either the EA internal sx.exe tool or the latest version of vgmstream to convert these files (specifically the ones labeled 1a12b6817e319af7)
