- Post Title: Trails of Cold Steel 3 (PC) - Phyre extract

I already know there exist a phyre engine made by someone else, however it does not appear to work on the DLC phyre, which is the only models that don't appear to exists in any other existing dumps of the game. Finding and decrypting a PS4 pkg is also impossible

Does anyone know how I could extract the PC Phyres for the models? I can provide a sample here:
-LINK REMOVED FOR SPACE-

I am only interested in the actual model file, it seems the dump place extracted all of the PC Textures already but not the models.

Ah shit... well its fixed now. I hate it when it doesn't actually share the link. Though that ruined a whole day of being on top of the page.

My tokyo xanadu tool seems to handle the sample fine. You can give it a try : [viewtopic.php?t=17859](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=17859)

Hi, thank you. I didn't know your tool existed, I kept trying to make Phyre Engine 2D work from Daemon or some other tool, I havn't tried yours just yet as I got a little busy in my life but I have it now and will give it a go later.
