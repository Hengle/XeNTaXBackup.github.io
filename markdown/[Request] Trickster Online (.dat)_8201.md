- Post Title: [Request] Trickster Online (.dat)

Hello all, good morning. Trickster Online is an MMORPG that interested me in the past, and as of recently I've realized how many unreleased data is left there to be uncovered.  It's been my hobby for the past week to find a way to get deeper in, most specifically into the item database.

Trickster's data is completely non-compressed with the exception of the language file (which is what I'm aiming for), the file that contains all the database is called libconfig_eng.dat. 


With the help of a Cheat Engine I managed to sniff only a small piece of that item database which I'm looking for, only items that I have in my inventory can be scanned, viewed in HEX and converted:

```
<GOODS goods_code="432044" goods_name="2012 Goodie Bag (P) 80" goods_desc="" goods_set_count="1" goods_limit_use="2" goods_limit_time="0" goods_cash_price="1900" goods_shop_new="1" goods_shop_popular="1" goods_category="1" goods_category0="11" goods_category1="101" goods_category2="0" goods_limit_desc="All Characters" goods_char_level="80" goods_char_sex="0" goods_char_type="8" goods_issell="1" goods_created="20120102" goods_filtercode1="0" goods_filtercode2="0" goods_filtercode3="0" goods_filtercode4="0" goods_filterlevel="0" goods_discount_price="1900" discount_start_date="1900-01-01 00:00:00" discount_end_date="1900-01-01 00:00:00" discount_display_date=""><GOODS_LIST item_index="432044" goods_name="2012 Goodie Bag (P) 80" item_count="1" item_class="1" preview_w="" preview_y="" preview_z="" preview_d="" goods_list_code="14439" parents_list_code="14439"/></GOODS>
```

Suggesting that most of their language files are kept as XML (Which isn't a surprise, really). However, I've been troubled with this for the past week and can't find a way to extract the file.
