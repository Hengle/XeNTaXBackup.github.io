Thanks, chrrox.
I have a question however, you seem to have a perfectly rendered model in that picture there.
On the other hand, I use Noesis, which is as far as I know, the only tool capable of converting the xfbin files.
But the model which shows up in the viewport and after exporting, looks messed up.



I have lurked quite a bit around the forum, so I of course first tried to find solution myself.

If this post doesn't belong in this thread, then sorry.

Oh, one more thing.

I used this to unpack the smaller "xfbin.cpk" files.

It's a modified cpk_unpacker, apparently for the Naruto models. But worked well for this game too.

Thanks.

Is there any way of viewing dialogue or move text? Be interesting to translate this game but all I can do is view models within xfbin using noesis =/

The extraction worked perfectly, thanks!

The only issue that I have is after I extract the data.cpk and use Kharaxel's method of using the Naruto extractor to unpack the "xfbin.cpk" files, the textures seem screwed up. I exported them and tried to re-align in maya but with no luck

 
That's what it looks like on the model
 
That's what the texture looks like in the UV editor.

Any idea how to correct this? Cheers in advance!

That's a problem with some offsets on some objects inside the model.
