- Post Title: PCGamingWiki - resource for fixing PC games

Hi there, I hope that it will be okay to post in this subforum as it is not completely about archives, but it is about game research and help. My aim is to find like-minded people who are interested in contributing to a project which will help PC gamers get their games working properly.

At PCGamingWiki, our aim is to collect fixes for every single PC game into one user-editable resource.

Featured by: [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/5889069/pcgamingwiki-wants-to-solve-the-biggest-problems-with-pc-gaming-intimidation-and-confusion), [Destructoid](http://www.destructoid.com/pc-gaming-wiki-2-0-aims-to-help-fix-every-pc-game-222697.phtml), [TotalBisctuit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW5ldLD0ysI#t=9m04s), [Rock Paper Shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/03/04/the-sunday-papers-208/)..

We are interested in:

performance issues and improvements
bugs, fixes and workarounds
configurations, optimisations and hacks
FOV and mouse acceleration fixes
which is the best available version
what restrictions and DRM does it have
save game and user data locations
mods, utilities and community patches
Here are some examples of recent articles:

Spec Ops: The Line
Civilization V
DayZ
Max Payne 3
Deus Ex

If you've ever fixed a game, or just know a tweak or piece of info that would be helpful to others, please contribute!

is this spam or what?

*edit*
probably not, it was just the post to have been written in a form used often by spammers here on the forum
sorry for the misunderstanding

Most of the existing articles are stubs, and do not seem to be as technical as they should.

I have some doubts and/or suggestions:

the domain pcgamingwiki.com has been created the 09 Feb 2012 and has a validity of only one year.
I understand the automatic renewal but it's rare to see a website with a long-term vision setting the minimum time for the domain moreover if there is a community that must provide the content
how it's possible that a website started the 09 Feb has received reviews/media after only 20 days?
I want to know the secret :)
why are used filehosting websites for the content? (dropbox and others) if these websites close down then the content goes lost, this can be a suggestion to the users who update the wiki there

Thanks for the feedback! To answer your comments..

I'll be sorting out the domain to renew for longer when the next cycle comes in. If you are concerned about content being lost, we actually have XML dumps made publicly available here: [http://pcgamingwiki.com/dumps/](http://pcgamingwiki.com/dumps/)

The site became quite popular due to a reddit post which reached the front page: [http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments ... _about_pc/](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/pjbjs/what_i_love_about_pc_gaming_what_i_hate_about_pc/)

Files can also optionally be hosted on our BitTorrent webseeding service (run on OpenTorrent tracker). If the site is ever lost, the tracker and swarm should still be able to continue distributing the files.

The site is relatively new (since February 2012) and does not have many people actively working on content, which is why I'm always looking for new people to help out. Even if most pages are stubs, or only contain one or two fixes, it still acts as a good central repository for that information.

I'm happy to take feedback on article structure/scope. Our sample article is here: [http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/PCGamingWi ... le_Article](http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/PCGamingWiki:Sample_Article) - this is what every page should aspire to be like. We're also continually working on new templates (for example, I'm trying to implement a game series template, for example, which lists a series of games like Quake 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. for easier navigation).

lol reddit, secret to successful websites.

I think some startups owe almost all their userbase to reddit. You'd also be surprised at just how many games news websites simply skim ideas off the top-voted content to turn their own pageviews.
