- Post Title: King of Dragon Pass - mTropolis authored game (.mfx / .mxx)

Hello all,

I'm trying to extract the graphics from the game "King of Dragon Pass", a demo for it can be downloaded here: [http://homepage.mac.com/dunham/KoDP-Tour.exe](http://homepage.mac.com/dunham/KoDP-Tour.exe)

It has been authored with a software called [mTropolis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTropolis) by mFactory. This was discontinued about 10 years ago when the company was bought by Quark, and I am unable to find any programs which work with the files, carrying the file extensions MFX and MXX.

From a little foray into Director authored games, I know that extracting stuff from authored games can be quite a problem, but if somebody could give me some pointers how to extract any graphics from the demo files, even if just heuristically, I'd be very happy.

If this isn't the right forum for this request, then please move the thread into a better forum.
