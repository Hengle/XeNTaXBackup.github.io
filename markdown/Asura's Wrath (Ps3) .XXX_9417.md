- Post Title: Asura's Wrath (Ps3) .XXX

Hello, I'm subtitled videos of the game into my language (PT) and was wondering if someone could help me in the files with extension. XXX, because I want to translate the texts, I need to know what is the compression used in these files, I tried to use extractor zlib but it only extracted a file, and came to see that the compression was not only that. If anyone knows what is the exact compression, or a tool that can help me, please post, thx.

gildor.org -> Unreal Package Extractor or Unreal Package Decompressor. Most of the time, the xxx files are upk files.
This van unpack/decompress, and than you can see the texts, if the file contain any. You can edit by hex editor, or you can try to find an editor.

And sometimes texts in unreal games is stored in Coalesced.int and has to be decoded, because simple editing in notepad++ will not help.

Hello, I finished translating the game, but I could see that the values ​​of the accents are not standard, so... most have accents in other languages​​, but there are 2 that I have not found, the "ã" and "õ" you would know you tell me where the sources? Thx.
