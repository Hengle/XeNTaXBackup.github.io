Hello I want to know if there is a method to order the vertices in a 3d.obj model ... I want the vertices to be in order 1, 2, 3 or 6, 5, 4 but the model that I want to import into the game has the vertices disordered for example 1, 3, 2

there is no correct or not correct orderâ€¦ faces not Always start with 1/1/1 2/2/2....
if the Faces are like in your "wrong order" example that doesnt mean they are wrong
if the mesh Looks good then its how it is
