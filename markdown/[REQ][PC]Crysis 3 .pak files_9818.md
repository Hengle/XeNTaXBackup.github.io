Oh Damn. I missed when they were handing the keys out too, but you should check if the crysis 2 script works on it.

[http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/crysis2.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/crysis2.bms)

I can't seem to find a source for the final files, aside from the encrypted preload from oct 31st.

You're best of with the Xbox 360 files if you ask me. You can just rename the .pak to .zip and they will be readable in standard unzippers like winrar. This is the same process for Crysis 2 aswell, I don't know how the PC files are but the Xbox version should have the same content so you could use them instead.

Going to make a decryption tool once I completely figured this out.
"They keys (there's 16 of them) and IV are the PAK."
What do you actually mean? 
I dont think they actually use Twofish.
They was still using XXTEA for pak encryption as for CE3 3.4.0 version at least.
As said Aluigi, author of quickbms, encryption key was stored in CrySystem.dll
Crysis 3 does not include dlls anymore, libraries are statically linked now. Origin includes anti-debugging code, so there's few ways: try to statically analyze it or wait till Crysis 3 release, to get cracked binary with out anti-debugging 
I've also found RSA public key in executable, and i find it embarrassing that they store it as is.
Maybe they store encryption key for paks the same way? As keys are 16 byte length, we could go through exe's strings with regex to find 16 byte length sequence?

I was unable to load the .cgfm files it Noesis myself. I guess that Noesis does not support Crysis 3 models so I made a quick python script to load them but it doesn't have full support YET.

Doesn't do an awful lot of validation, so it might hang or crash, but it shouldn't (was fine with the files I tested).

Those links give me a 404 :/
Though I'm pretty sure that the files will be decrypted in the full game. Thats hot it went with Crysis 2 back then. Alpha and Beta had encrypted pak files and the full game had plain zip.

Thank you, unsure why it was taken down but hopefully this works with the retail data from the pre-load as well, or maybe it needs some update if they altered the encryption.

Will be interesting to see what the config files and other data has.


EDIT: Somewhat expected but yeah it didn't work with that version.

The Decrypter is not working for Crysis 3 official, the output zip file is not openable. I used it with Scripts.pak and resulted Scripts.zip, but most of its content was 00. I hope someone will make a encrypter too

The preload of the release version has some encrypted and unencrypted .pak files. For example Videos.pak is unencrypted and is a simple zip file but for example Textures.pak is encrypted.
I wonder why.

Many thanks for the updated decrypter haoose!
Though do you think it might be possible to reverse it and encrypt the files again? I can't get the game launched with the decrypted files 
You can have a look at the ressources but sadly no modding yet as long as the game keeps having a black screen with the decrypted files :/
With Crysis 2 you could just unpack them and it would be fine but thats not the case here aswell. Neither unpacked nor decrypted files seem to work.

It's virtually impossible to re-encrypt, due to the use of assymetric cryptography on the twofish IV and keys and also the signing of the PAKs.

How would I apply these options?
I tried it with a autoexec.cfg with:
sys_PakPriority = 0
sys_PakValidateFileHash = 0

Also tried to put them into GFE.cfg and game.cfg in the USER folder but nothing worked :/
Weirdly some files get loaded from folders (with or without adding these lines) but things like sounds not.

I was able to decrypt Textures.pak with PakDecrypt but all the dds files are using weird numerical extensions.
Like this:
concrete.dds.0
concrete.dds.1
concrete.dds.2
concrete.dds.3
etc.

I can't open those even if I rename them to .dds. Are those different mipmap levels separated to own file?

They are compiled Cryengine 3 ressources and probably aren't compatible with standard DDS modules.
the Cryengine 3 supports the AMD compression for DDS textures which is afaik not supported by Nvidias photoshop plugin.

Like this:
concrete.dds.0 concrete.dds.1 concrete.dds.2 concrete.dds.3 etc.

I can't open those even if I rename them to .dds. Are those different mipmap levels separated to own file?

Have you finally opened these .dds files, with the updated DDS tools mentioned by "Ekey".

And are these textures from PC version or XBOX version?
Please tell me.

Use this to reconstruct normal DDS files: [http://sktest.aruarose.com/DDSUnsplit.7z](http://sktest.aruarose.com/DDSUnsplit.7z).

As for the format, .dds.0 contains the header and smallest three mips, .dds.1 to .dds.n contain the remaining mips with increasing size.

Is it possible to get the game to use the decrypted or uncompressed files?

I've tested, Its not possible to use the decrypted or uncompressed files, I think there are a hash check, resulting a black screen when you run the game.
Eg: when you rename English_xml.pak to German_xml.pak

However, in the CryEngine 3 SDK, there are a tool (RC Tool) which can pack a zip, if we have the key we can repack zips..

```
        Specify compression level for zipped files. [0-9] 0=no compression, 9=ma
        x compression. Default is 6.
   
   /zip_encrypt
        Encrypts headers of zip files. Disabled by default.
   
   /zip_encrypt_content
        Encrypts files inside of zip. Works only when zip_encrypt enabled. Disab
        led by default.
   
   /zip_encrypt_key
        Specifies a 128-bit key in hexadecimal format: 32-character string. Low 
        endian format.
```

Using this commandline
rc /zip M:\test\english_xml_pak_SDK_dec\*.xml M:\test\x.zip
fails:
    0:00 Using sort method to add to pack : alphabetically
    0:00 Requested 6 files to be packed. Found 6 valid files to add.
    0:00 Found 6 valid files to add to zip file
E:  0:00 Failed to create zip file

Any ideas?

BTW the created zip would be a "pak"? (means identical format?)

Crysis 2 had a crysis2.xml file for the ingame use of the music. Does such a file exist for CRYSIS 3?

It should be inside the music.pak archive, but I cant seem to extract anything with the given tools 

If so, can anyone here attach it? I may get my hands on the music through filesharing, but would like to rename the files according to levels and placement.

something strange with 2 files video.pak and video2.pak. They are just normal zip files but has a symbol in comment section. And game does not load the re-zip files.

I know this is an old thread, but is anyone able to help with decrypting the Star Citizen Scripts.pak ? Star Citizens recently released Arena Commander module has now encrypted that file.

These URL's work (at least when I posted this):

I don't know if these were the last version of these two utilities, but they are at least a version of them.  The Internet Archive doesn't have a later capture for these files.
