- Post Title: Unity Assets Bundle Extractor / UABE: FBX plugin

I have some rigged models in UABE and I want to export them as FBX files and not OBJ since I want the rigging on.

Please get me a FBX plugin becasue I want to keep the rigging on my models.

Did you try using Unity Studio/Asset Studio instead? They export models directly to FBX and have built-in bundle extraction.

AssestStudio was able to assist cara membuat halaman di word
However, the animations of the app gave .fbx files. Don't suppose you know of anything to view and extract?
