- Post Title: Game maps/stages to obj etc

I know I have asked it before and threads have gone to oblivion (read page 200) or such but I want to know of any good tools to convert game maps to .obj etc.

I have found this tool that seems great and looking for similar for other games:

Any suggestions?

Don't take this the wrong way, but you really need to be more specific.

While there are programs that can convert multiple formats... MOST programs usually only work on one game's format.

Pick a game and ask about that, if there are other people interested, you may actually get the format cracked, if in fact no one has done so already.

Don't think, however, that the popularity of the game itself will get it looked at. FF9 was a really good game, and as far as the hacking for it went was documentation. I had to code my own model converter for it in order to get anything from it.

Due to quirks of said format, the models come out without any semblance of their original form, however they are intact and correct... they just need a lot of reworking in order to unfold the characters that are all crumpled up.



Now, what game do you need maps from, and what do you need them for? Most converters cannot reconvert models into the original game format, so making mods won't be simple in most cases.

There is a program called 3D RipperDX that can get models from Direct X 9 games, and 3D Via Printscreen can get things from other games, but they are not without their quirks.

In order to get anything accomplished, you will need to focus on something specific and come back then.

Well I don't have game specific request, I just want to know if people out there are using or have seen any special converters. The one I posted is great, I get a whole counter-strike map in max to play around with. I just want to see the maps and perhaps edit them but also put them in a game engine.

I guess there should be some map editors/viewers for alot of games I just have trouble finding it 

But so far the tool I found has worked great so I am pleased so far

3D ripper I have been using since version 1.2 and was very very active in their forum. But the tool is only so good that it captures what you see and you need to actually play a game to use it. I have alot of korean mmo game where I don't even have an account  Those models and maps need some kind of viewer/converter

I can't tell you how many MMOs like that I wish I had the models from, but in the end, it isn't worth my time to try understanding the format, and most likely no one here is interested in those obscure games... So I really don't see much turning up unless you surf the japanese file exploration forums... those are usually the places that have the really cool programs... however, you DO have to be able to read Jp to find them...

Good luck in any case.

well chrrox often share my passion for certain models so that I have no problem with. It's just the stages that lack support  But what you cannot find you can also make yourself so I will do more myself
