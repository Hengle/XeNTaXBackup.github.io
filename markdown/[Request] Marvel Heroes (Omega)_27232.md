- Post Title: [Request] Marvel Heroes (Omega)

(This is a repost of my thread on Ragezone)

Hello guys, and thanks for reading this thread about the discontinued Mmo Marvel Heroes (Omega)

I don't know if many are aware, but there exists a server emu project for this game called:
MHServerEmu Development

When asking one of the devs of the project on the current state and plans of the future, this is what they had to say:

> MHServerEmu is in the early stages of development. Right now you can log in, run around hubs and a number of combat zones, use some powers that don't require a server response to function, and chat.
>
> 
>
> The end goal is to develop software that others can use to host servers however they want.
>
> Everything is open source, and we do not have any plans to host servers ourselves.
>
> We're currently working with the client version 1.52, but eventually we would like to also support 1.53, 1.48 and some day 1.10

I was hoping there might be people interested in that game on here and maybe someone even has server packets from back then,
the devs of the project would especially be interested in packets from version 1.48, 1.53, 1.10 but pretty much any version besides 1.52

If you are interested on getting updates on the state of the project, would like to contribute or have any of those server packets you'd be willing to share, feel free to join their Discord Server [https://discord.gg/Q5pJdrycxpr](https://discord.gg/Q5pJdrycxpr)
