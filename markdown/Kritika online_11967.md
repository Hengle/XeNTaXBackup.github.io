Hi guys! I have extracted some files from kritika and wonder if someone can look at format?

There is basically this structure:

dds
.bone
.modelformat
.anim
.meshinfo
.mesh

Here is a wooden box that should be the easiest 3d model to base on

@rumour12

Importer works for old client.
Newest don't use modelinfo as text file but binary.


Edit 2015-01-10:

Here is importer for ModelInfoB and MeshInfoB files.
It requires Blender version 249 and Python 26.
How use:
1.unpack importer
2.run Blender249.blend
3.in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select:
- ModelInfoB - for models with skeleton, vertexgroups are as bone names
- MeshInfoB - for models , but vertexgroups are as numbers

Sample

Works perfect with the new CBT NA client, thanks Szkaradek123! Is it possible to get support for the animation files? 
Cheers
