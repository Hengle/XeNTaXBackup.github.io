How do I rip the character customization system from a game to make it a standalone app on my PC? I want to do this with Sunset Overdrive but is it possible to do it with other games?

Nope nope nope for 2984209432 reasons.

Sunset Overdrive is an Xbox One game, for now, you can't do anything with them.
To start ripping, you need the amazing skills these guys on forums got.
To make an app or a 3D viewer (I suppose that's what you are trying to do) you will need programming skills, plus all the models/textures ripped.

I suggest that you read and research more about game ripping!
