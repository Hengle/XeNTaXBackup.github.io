compared to my slz.bms it uses the compression type 3 which is unknown and I have noticed also some problems in retrieving the compressed and decompressed size

sorry for bringing the old thread back up, but seems that one user at romhacking forums figured out SLZ type3 compression. and also how to decrypt the disk TOC in ps2 tri-ace games.

Thank you for the update! I sadly gave this up because this was out of my reach at the time....

There has been an update on the romhacking dicussion about tri-ace ps2 file formats. There is a model of a face on the ps23dformat website but I believe that was obtained via ramdump from PCSX2. No full body models yet.
