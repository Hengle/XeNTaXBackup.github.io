- Post Title: Final Fantasy X/X-2 Battle Mod

Hey there, modders

I am literally a super FFX Fan since I was a child. Since then, i really wanted to mod ffx because personally, I think their AI is too predictable and not so aggressive. What I wish to mod is this:

1. More Aggressive AI (uses higher tier skills for example and the trigger of certain action)
2. Edit Monster Status that includes elemental affinity and HP/MP
3. Edit Player status skills
4. Edit Battle Formation Random Encounter like 5 Wolfs in Besaid Island
5. Maybe custom enemy (Optional)

Is it possible to do that? I wish a certain expert modder of FFX would be able to help me achieve my dream. Thank you 

NOTE: I have already extracted VBF File and get the dump. They are all still in phyre format which I am stuck at this point
