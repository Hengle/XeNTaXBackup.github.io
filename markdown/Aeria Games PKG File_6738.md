It's not on the list, but I can open the nif files you provided.
But hey that's pretty cool, I didn't know about this game lol

The clothes are kind of cute.

Unfortunately it seems like you'll have to figure out which textures go with which model yourself unless there's a way to extract the files with all the filenames as well. Don't know if that kind of thing is possible with offzip.

Seems like most aeria games use pkg files.
Grand Fantasia as well.

Just saw that this will be a necro but it doesnt matter  Aura kingdom from aeriagames works perfectly with script. Its even older version of nif so works in niftools too
