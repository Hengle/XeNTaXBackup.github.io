Hi, I believe the mdf archive is encrypted.
I have uploaded the data below.

Please may anyone shine a light on this archive type and how to decrypt/unpack it?

Thanks!

The game is made on the [Rapid Fire Engine](https://www.mobygames.com/group/10355/game-engine-rapidfire/)
There are no unpackers for this engine. So far, no one has had the heart to cope with such archives, it's shameful.
