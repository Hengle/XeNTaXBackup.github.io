- Post Title: Guardians of the Galaxy asset ripping help

I want to extract assets (specifically model data, level geometry, shaders and textures) to do artwork in Blender. Has anyone figured out how to extract the game files, or do we still have to wait until someone reverse-engineers the game engine?
