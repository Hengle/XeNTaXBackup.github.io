Holy Cow, who would have thought!

If an honest teaser, then perhaps it is not Vaporware. But I remain sceptic.

They chose a very fitting title. XD A few months later 3D Realms runs out of funding then it would be "Duke Nukem Never".

Oh well, maybe they will actually release it BEFORE 2009. Because they are really dragging it out. No way it could take THIS long if they were being serious about it. >_<

If they DO get it out, this vaporware, question is: will it be any good?
