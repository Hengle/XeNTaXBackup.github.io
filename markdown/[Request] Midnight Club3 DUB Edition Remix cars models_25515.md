- Post Title: [Request] Midnight Club3 DUB Edition Remix cars models

Hello, everyone. 

I have been trying to get models from Midnight Club3 DUB Edition Remix version of the game, as there are some cars that do not exist elsewhere. 

I have already checked the [research thread](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12738&hilit=midnight+club+3), but I, with a limited knowledge on the topic, couldn't find a way to make any of the methods inside the thread to work with my PS2 copy of the game. 
So far I already explored the asset.dat file, but I have no clue on how to extract those pck files, neither do I understand about Model Researcher.

So is it possible to request for the extra 24 cars that are included in the Remix version, or at least guide me on how to extract them out?
([Majority of other models in the normal version were already extracted by darkvaytor.](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12738&p=183898#p183898))

Thank you in advance.
