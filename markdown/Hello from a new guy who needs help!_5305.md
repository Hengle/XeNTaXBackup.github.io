- Post Title: Hello from a new guy who needs help!

Hi everyone!

I just started getting into modding for the original x-box, one of the games I want to mod is WWE Raw 2.  So far everything has worked smoothly like changing music and videos (wav and xmv files).  Now there is an fpk file in the main dir called scene.fpk.  I was told if I want to add more Titantrons (entrance videos) I need to edit this file with either CSVED or Excel and add more lines.  I have been having a NIGHTMARE of a time trying to get this to work... so far NOTHING works

Every time I open it with Excel it wants to screw with the formatting, also when trying to open with CSVED it just does not work at all.  I have been following tutorials on a really old Raw 2 community board from posts that are as old as 2007 and it seems that people there got it to work... but I cannot!!!  

I also saw this thread: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=1159](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=1159) 

It seems that there maybe hope here.

If anyone knows how to edit this damn fpk file so I can add more lines and save it so it works please please please PLEASE!!! let me know I am starting to get desperate.

btw if you are not sure what I am talking about here is an example

there is a list in the file that goes like this

64,stephaniemcmahon,scha_063
65,RAW,scha_64
giberish after this

from what I understand its in the 64th slot, name is stephaniemcmahon or Stephanie McMahon some characters do not show up right in excel or csved. scha_063 is the name of the video scha_063.xmv

I want to had several more videos and I have tried but when starting the game it just freezes and does not start so I have to keep reverting back to the original scene file
