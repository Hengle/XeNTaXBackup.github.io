Hey guys.. so I got this game with some nice looking models but couldn't extract it with Umodel cuz it need AES key and I had no idea what's the first thing to do to find the AES key for the pak file.
So if any of you know how to do this then I'll thank you on behalf of all those who'll benefit from your work =).
