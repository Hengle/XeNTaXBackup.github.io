so i want to replace a song in littlebigplanet 1 (ps3) and the file format used for audio is fsb, when i use a fsb extractor the file only contains a wav, which i am able to extract and edit. The hard part is trying to put the wav back into the fsb. I have tried countless methods to try and recreate the fsb and replace the files within the fsb but to no avail. Please could someone help me with creating a new fsb file because this has been so painstakingly annoying
