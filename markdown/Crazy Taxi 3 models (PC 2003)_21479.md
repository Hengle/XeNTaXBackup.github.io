- Post Title: Crazy Taxi 3 models (PC 2003)

Crazy Taxi is one of my favorite arcade games ever, and I was really surprised to find that no assets or sprites of it exist online, anywhere. Not even VG Resource.

I recently downloaded Crazy Taxi 3 on an abandonware website and was wondering if I could rip the models from it. The only things that can be viewed are startups PNGs, a loading screen AVI and the songs on OGG format.

The sprites are stored in a .art format, and I've tried opening them with XnView and ImageMagick, I even downloaded a Windows 98 VM and installed AOL 8.0 on it to no avail.

The 3d models are stored in a .mdl format, and I've tried using Crowbar to decompile them, but that only works on source engine mdl files.

I've succesfully ripped 3D models like characters using 3D Ripper DX, but it rips each individual sprite used instead of the sprite sheet. So when you open a rip on a 3D viewer, it has like 300 materials instead of 10. Also it only rips what is loaded so a very small section of the map. Weird digression, but I've always wanted to have the whole model for the map because when you play the game you don't really pay attention to it, since you are going 100 mph against a timer, so having the map model is what I really want.



If anyone can help me, or point me towards whatever can help get these models out, that'd be great

It would be great if you could upload sample files

Oops, my bad.  I tried uploading the one I suspected as being the map model but it was too large to attach, so I chose a random one. In the zip are a .mdl and .art file.

Finally, someone who is trying to extract Crazy Taxi models. I don't know much about extractions, but if you use Discord, you could possibly learn more on how to extract models by joining Ninja Ripper's Discord. Also, I was wondering if you could have the vehicle uploaded, with Axel inside of the vehicle, to Garry's Mod? Thank you!
