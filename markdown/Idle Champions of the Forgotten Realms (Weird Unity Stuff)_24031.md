- Post Title: Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms (Weird Unity Stuff)

Hey, I've been wanting to extract the portraits and sprite images of specific heroes from this game, and I'm aware it runs in Unity. Unfortunately, everything is kept in weird compressed files that AssetStudio does not recognize and I can't make any sense of. I've packed up a few of them to have a look at, of my personal favorite hero.

Not actually unity files, more like side-loaded assets. Here is script for extracting images from most of those types, the rest of data in files is more like system data for their usage.
