Very unlikely that someone downloads an 822 MB sized   compressed archive just for fun, imho.

Look at the header, compare it to the archives the tools work with, do more research, etc.

did a little more research using hexitor on some files, Looks like these are packed files, Would there be a QuickBMS script or another decompiler for these?
