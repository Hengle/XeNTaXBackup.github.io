Hello. I'd love to see Heroes of Might and Magic 2 support. Is that possible?

Hmm, well, you can try this in Mex3Scriptor. 

[Look here for details on how to do this](http://www.xentax.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=93)

Get FC Int 0 ;
For T = 1 To FC ;
Get D Long 0 ;
Get FO Long 0 ;
Get FS Long 0 ;
Log FN FO FS 0 0 ;
Next T ;

In Mex3Scriptor to extract (nameless) files, but that is far from exactlt the format. There's more to this format. And I haven't figured out yet what. 
Not much help here.
