- Post Title: Unity TextMesh and Font_raw files

I've been trying to research files in game That Dragon, Cancer and I have encountered a few problems during that activity. I am just curious if somebody have any working tool which supports editing those files extracted by UnityEx:

Extension     |Type
.font_raw     |128 (Font)
.102            |102 (TextMesh)


I have tried to replace text (larger than original) in textmesh, then change size value, adjust padding and import back to asset by UnityEx, but the game shows up empty string instead of the new one.

Samples below:

Font_raw are not textures, just for your information.

You can edit texture file in Unity Assets Bundle Extractor:
