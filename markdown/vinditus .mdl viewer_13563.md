As far as I can tell, you will need .mdl decompiler to get models. Then, you can use Noesis, amazing tool by MrAdults. Noesis handle .mdl files from Vindictus (and not only from this game) perfectly. Or just remove word .comp from file name, and try to load model into Noesis, maybe it will work without decompiler.

There's a tool Bulk Rename Utility, it's easily can rename all files in the folder in one click. Or any other similar program, just google "batch rename" or smt if you don't like this one

This is most likely due to format changes, maybe new revisions of engine. This issue, you will have too clean for yourself   Those spoiled parts I mean.

Noesis does not display Vindictus models perfectly. Use Noesis to quick browse files and find the models you are looking for, but MDLdecompiler to get a non-broken one (the resulting .smd file will not have the errors you showed and it should show up just fine in Noesis too if you plan to convert to another file format).
