thanks a lot but it doesnt work me. i use GameAssassin 1305 shared version. it is works. GameAssassin 1305 version only captures 3d model. I need full version for skeleton capture and animation.

GameAssassin  1305 share version download link. Only 3d capture

Is there any real evidence this actually works though? I remember downloading some version of this program months ago and I couldn't even figure out how to use it because it was in Chinese and it kept throwing me an error I couldn't understand. 

Anyway it claims to rip models in their default pose AND a skeleton? Sounds too good to be true to be honest.

I am using the shared version right now(1305 shared version). I can capture 3d models(only directx game) but  this version is limited.skeleton and animation capture features are disabled.

By 3d models do you mean in a tpose state or their default pose they were ripped in?

It is mentioned here that T pose can be taken: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5913](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5913). I haven't used it much yet. i'm just looking for skeleton and animation.

Huh interesting. I'll have to give this a run for its money then. Does this work with Dolphin emulator by any chance? That'd be very helpful.

Well I looked through the thread you linked in regards to the tpose capturing and all, RandomTalkingBrush confirmed it does not work with Dolphin emulator sadly. This tool, I mean I can't even get it to work but it seems pretty useless tbh.
