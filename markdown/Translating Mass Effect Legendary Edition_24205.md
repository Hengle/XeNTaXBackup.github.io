If text is not encrypted or compressed, then you can just use total commander method to find it

If this game really uses UE3, then you could try gildor's tools

This is the package with the language file, but the editor you are using is only for opening the graphic files, because the pcc file is locked, the full content cannot be opened

It wasn't totally fleshed out a year ago, but still.. there already was a totally dedicated tool for the games.
