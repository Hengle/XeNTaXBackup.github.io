- Post Title: Has anybody here looked at the streams.wav file in Hitman 3?

I know that most of it consists of OGGs, like in Hitman II, and I extracted them, but there are about 110 MB of the OGGs in total, and the whole streams.wav is well over 200 MB in size. That leaves almost 100 MB of some other sound data, which looks compressed. I thought these were regular MP3s, but they are not... has anyone here tried messing with that file and perhaps identified what else is in it, other than the OGGs?
