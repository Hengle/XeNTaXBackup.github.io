- Post Title: [HELP] Converting old GTX (header GTX1) images that won't open in anything I've tried

Hello. I've been playing Lost Kingdoms 2 on the Gamecube, and decided to see if I could open the files within. For starters, what I'm guessing are the card images are in the GTX image format. The guides and help forums online say that this can be converted to DDS. However, I tried TexConv2 to no avail ([https://puu.sh/EZd2t/407142459f.png](https://puu.sh/EZd2t/407142459f.png)). I also tried TexHaxU, Noesis, and GTX Extractor (this seems to only be for Gfx2), which also failed. I'm guessing this is the older format of the GTX image type. Here's what the hex looks like.

Now, I could and have simply dumped the textures with Dolphin, but I figured I should make a thread asking about it so that the question (and hopefully solution) is out there in case other games also use this older GTX format.

Here are the sample images. Thanks for any help!
