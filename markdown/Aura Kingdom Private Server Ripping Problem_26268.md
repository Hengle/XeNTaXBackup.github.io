- Post Title: Aura Kingdom Private Server Ripping Problem

I am having problems when trying to extract models from the Aura Kingdom private server, I am using quickbms with "Aeriagames.bms" but when I start the extraction I get the following problem.


"Error: uncompressed data (-1) bigger than allocated buffer (1151476)
      It usually means that data is not compressed or uses another algorithm

Last script line before the error or that produced the error:
  47  clog NAME OFFSET ZSIZE SIZE 1"


Is there a solution for this problem?
