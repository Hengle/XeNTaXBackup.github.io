- Post Title: KRV Files

I saw another thread on this, but some posts on it were missing and the thread itself appears to have died out.
So, does anyone know how to extract models and textures from KRV files?
Here is one from Spyro Dawn of The Dragon: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/wdeodcpxw ... 0.zip/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/wdeodcpxwaaa44p/DoTD_LVL030.zip/file)
