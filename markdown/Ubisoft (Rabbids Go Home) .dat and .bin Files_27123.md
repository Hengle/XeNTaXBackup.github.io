- Post Title: Ubisoft (Rabbids Go Home) .dat and .bin Files

So in Rabbids Go Home, within a .bf archive, there are hundreds of these files with a number of different extensions. Most of them have either a .dat or a .bin file extension. Does anyone know what these are or how to extract them? 

I'm not sure if these files are to be audio, models or whatever they may be. Specifically, I'm looking for the game's music. It's not the .sns files because those are too small and also are just sound effects, so it must be within these.

These are from the PC version, but as far as I know the console versions are the same.

Here are some examples of each: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/vdjvsmb9 ... s.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/vdjvsmb9puyoy5d/examples.zip/file)

Thank you for your time.
