Hello, i'm here for a little help, because i tried to export the model from the mobile game Jurassic World : The Game. This game work with unity, so i tried some tool for export the files and import it in 3ds max, without success. So i wanted to know if it's really possible to extract the files? Because i see so many mobiles games having they're 3d models exported. 

I wanted to know if it's possible to extract the files from an another mobile app : ICarltonAR
It's a mobile app where you can play with the dinosaur of Jurassic World in virutal reality, but the interresting things is the 3D model in this application are directly from the production models ( from the movie ) 

Thank you for your help and sorry for my bad english.

Probably no point replying since this post is 5 years old lol, but I managed to get the models by using AssetStudio and loading up the main folder extracted from the APK. Then you'll be able to export the meshes as OBJ and FBX, and you can also obtain sound files
