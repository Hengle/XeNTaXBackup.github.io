- Post Title: Help finding sprites

Hello,

Im working in a project and i need to find the sprites models of this game [https://saiyan-saga-mystery-saiyan.es.aptoide.com/](https://saiyan-saga-mystery-saiyan.es.aptoide.com/).

Anyone know where i can find them? or if i can rip them from the game?

Thx for all!!
