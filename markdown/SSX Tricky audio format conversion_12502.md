- Post Title: SSX Tricky audio format conversion?

Okay, so I ripped the audio from SSX Tricky (PS2).
There's no extension, but opening it hex shows a header saying "SCH1".

They seem to be high-quality compressed, and play in MPC just fine, but I would like to convert them, and they don't load in Audition.
Here are "It's Tricky" and "Bonecracker" for examples.

It's EA\XA stream. Convertable with winamp plugins in_cube, in_vgmstream and Electronic Arts Sound eXchange. Just rename to .MUS\.SNG.
