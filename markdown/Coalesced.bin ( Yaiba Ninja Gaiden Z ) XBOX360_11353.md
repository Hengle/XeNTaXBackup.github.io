in PC verison all files are in the clear, ie does not have a file coalecsed.bin, as in all games on Unreal Engin for PC.
AES encryption is likely in this case, but as a rule with him, I do not know. It seems to need the executable file to it to find a key for decryption. If you need it, then I give it too.
or here XOR encrypted.

Job done. Here my tool for decrypt and encrypt - Tested only on PS3 version files.. Let me know if it not works on XBOX Coalesced files.

```
        YNGZCoalescedTool <pMode> <pInFile> <pOutFile>

[Modes]
        -d - Decrypt
        -e - Encrypt

[Examples]
        YNGZCoalescedTool -d COALESCED_INT.BIN COALESCED_INT.BIN.DEC
        YNGZCoalescedTool -e COALESCED_INT.BIN.DEC COALESCED_INT.BIN
```


Also in archive additional tool for unpack and pack BIN files - Seems author Gocha

Steps:
1) Decrypt BIN
2) Unpack decrypted BIN
3) Edit files
4) Pack BIN
5) Encrypt packed BIN
6) Profit

Enjoy

I have tested the tools on your file and they work perfectly.
