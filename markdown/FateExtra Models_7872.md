TXB are almost certainly textures, though they aren't viewable in raw format, save for a few, as they are twiddled or swizzled or whatever that word is that MrAdults like to use.

In any case, I believe noesis can also open the CPK files... at least I think it can. Anyway, I'll have a look at the PAK unpacker and see if I recognize anything it outputs... I recall looking for the models in this earlier but having no luck.

EDIT:
Txb contains image data, as does ____.psp.im. .IM is in a format I'm not certain of yet, looks to be 2 dimensional rather than 1... I'll test it...

EDIT2:
IM is twiddled 1dimensional 8bpp
