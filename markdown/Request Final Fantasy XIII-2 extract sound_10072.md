- Post Title: Request: Final Fantasy XIII-2 extract sound

I know there's a quickbms script for FFXIII that extracts just about everything. If possible I would like one for FFXIII-2.

The same script from FFXIII works on FFXIII-2 also, its here in the forums, itmight not actually be the EXACT same script, but there is a Noesis plugin for XIII-2.

When you say sound however, do you mean soundtrack or do you mean sound effects?

I mean sound effects and voices. I tried the script for FFXIII but it only extracts TRB and IMGB files. I know the sound files from FFXIII were SCD files.

I've been looking for such a long time now that I would be willing to pay somebody to create a script that extracts sound effects and voices.

I just tried multi extractor and it extracted everything I was looking for.
