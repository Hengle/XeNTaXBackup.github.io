Hi was wondering if anyone could help me with a game called Eve Online [http://www.eve-online.com](http://www.eve-online.com). Trying to open the .stuff files, you can download the client for free on there site. Any help would be great.

Sorry if this is a stupid question but I have never used this program before, I download the one bug test told me about and when I double click it MultiEx Starts up but then gives this error .
MultiEx Startup Error
Could not find any archive formats associated with this file.

the 'Bugtest' has nothing to do with multiex!!!

unzip where you have your .stuff files.

launch the cmd dos window  (start,click run and enter cmd)

go into the dir where you unpacked the eveext.exe and the .stuff are and launch eveext (name).stuff


if you can't..i can't more..its basis.
