- Post Title: Ridge Racer Accelerated [iOS | *.DAT file]

So, I was able to figure out how I could get RR Slipstream models with NinjaRipper and an Android emulator, which did what I needed it to, since I couldn't make heads or tails of the advanced mesh reaper program that  was used to import the Slipstream SCX's, so I've been slowly trying to figure out how to get car and track data with NinjaRipper, which is a lot slower since I am exporting the same objects multiple times over again, and then having to put it together like lego, it's.. interesting.

Now to the present file, a DAT file from Ridge Racer Accelerated, I've not really been able to find.. well, anything on how to emulate iOS so I could do the same NinjaRipper tinkering, so I'm at a bit of a loss on what to do, so I figured I'd attach a sample and hope someone smarter than me can figure out how these work.

Okay... Now, I'm even more confounded, looking at the files in Notepad++, I'm seeing that the info file can be read, but I haven't really seen anything else that can be read, or.. really, anything to tell me what any of these files are to begin with, feeling rather lost

Files of type 1 and 3 appear to be textures.


While those of type 2 apparently are mesh files.
