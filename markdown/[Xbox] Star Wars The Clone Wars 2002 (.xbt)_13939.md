Here is a Noesis plugin to open the xbt textures extracted from the game files
*updated April 26, 2017*

Supports dxt1 and dxt3 xbt textures with partial support for 2 more types. I have not figured them out completely yet.
There is no data type check because i have not figured out how to do this when the file has no magic header.   

You can extract the files from the data.zwp with aluigi's bms script here

The format is mostly dds with a custom header but i am proud of this script because it is my first real one and
i wanted the practice and now you can open these files with Noesis.  

edit
I have updated the script with partial support for two more texture types i ran into with this game, i am not 100% sure
 what they are but the updated script will let you view and convert all of the textures without hitting errors.   
when i figure out exactly what the two types are i will update the plugin again.
