sorry if i've offended you or anything, its just that secunia has looked at total commander and the did find something:

[http://secunia.com/product/14429/](http://secunia.com/product/14429/)
[http://secunia.com/product/3312/](http://secunia.com/product/3312/)

total commander is another program like mex btw

mostly they search for holes a virus could use to attack someone's computer, not if the program is a virus
they search things that could create buffer overflows or allow others to cause a DoS on your computer
