- Post Title: .EXC, Legend of Blood archives

*.EXC pseudoarchives from Legend of Blood (open beta). It is simple format, as I see in hex viewer. But I can't unpack it with existed unpackers and don't know how to write good BMS script. Anyone can help to extract?

One: [http://www.multiupload.com/W85LVZ2DTQ](http://www.multiupload.com/W85LVZ2DTQ)
Inside the archive are NIF, KFM and KF files. All of them started with header "Gamebryo File Format".

            math OFFSET += BASE_OFF
            set FNAME string PATH
            string FNAME += /
