- Post Title: Trying to rip the soundtrack from a japanese ps2 game

Hello everyone, i was wondering if anybody knew how to rip the music off a ps2 disc. The reason i wanna do this because the soundtrack is nowhere online, and I've never really done anything like this before. The game is called "kidou shinsengumi moeyo ken". I tried using a ps2 emulator to possibly record the songs off there but its sounds terrible.
