Dude, you created a thread yesterday and another one today AND the game already had its own thread. Are you this dumb?
It is NOT possible yet. Get over it.

I was wondering why so many people came here asking for something that's too early to be done while neither can they provide any sample files nor can they contribute anything valuable to the topic, but just to ask some dumb questions despite the answer is known already.

Isn't it also kind of weird that you are asking people to rip from a brand new game just for a model of a little girl? Sounds pretty weird to me, to be honest.
