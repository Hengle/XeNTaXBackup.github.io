- Post Title: UnrealPak Problem Unreal 4

Hi
I wanted to say that I have trouble Unpack files that are in pak format.
And when I use UnrealPakTool Master software, it gives me an error.
I will show you that error in a image.
If you know how to fix this problem, please tell me.

You can always try any other program\script listed in this article
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Unreal_Engine_4_PAK](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Unreal_Engine_4_PAK)

Also, if your PAK file is encrypted, you have to specify correct key in the extract command.

I used a lot of software but they all have the same problem.
How do I get the key to the game I want?

There are some sites/forums that are gathering such keys.
One of them is listed in the "See Also" section on the wiki.
