- Post Title: Adam's Venture - .upk extension [uses Unreal 3 engine]

So this small advanture game uses Unreal 3 engine, and it has the .upk extension.
Is it editable/unpackable/repackable?
(We are trying to translate this game, this file contains all the necessary texts.)

Thanks in advance;)

Sorry, my fault, I've uploaded the correct file now.

Repacking is much more complicated. I don't think there's a tool, but sometimes the engine can read unpacked data (without the upk, just the folder structure).
