Hi guys,I am new around here and i just started to learn how to extract 3d models from games.My first approach is with noesis.I saw a video and realized that its easy to extract models.However when i tried to do it i found it hard.My first obstacle was that the games that i downloaded have no package files(.fpk) but when i mount the iso i have a bin file which can't be further extracted.So i wonder if you must have an original game bought and not a copy downloaded. Can someone guide me of how i can extract the models?I want to start by something simple like models from psp games.
