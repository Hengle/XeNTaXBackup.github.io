Yes, I have always been playing with the idea. Never had time to think about it seriously. I could be nicely combined with a file identification function as well.

It would be good to have one that combines all the rippers out there because they all do different formats. The HyperRipper does like 35 formats or something, particularly the MPEG formats. I have a Scanner in Game Extractor which does about 15 formats, mostly images and some odd ones like webpages and PS2 TIM images, and there are a lot of other programs that just do 1 or 2 formats.

I would support the creation of a combined program or collection of resources that would allow all our ripper programs to be consistent in the formats they support. Anyone have any specs?

In effect, we are still talking about the Eureka project then, somewhere here in the Code Talk forum.
