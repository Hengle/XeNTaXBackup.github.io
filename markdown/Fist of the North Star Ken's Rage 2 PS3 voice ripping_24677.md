Hello, I've got an interest in ripping some voices from this game, I found this 10 years old thread  
[viewtopic.php?f=21&t=6290](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=6290) 
for the first game tho, and x360, however I did try the method suggested there: there is indeed a voice.pac file, and I used this script for quickbms:

```
reverselong FILES
for i = 0 < FILES
    padding 0x800
    savepos OFFSET
    getdstring RIFF_SIGN 4
    get SIZE long
    math SIZE += 8
    log "" OFFSET SIZE
    math OFFSET += SIZE
    goto OFFSET
next i
```


I have no idea if it is correct in any way but I got 11kish *.wav files, which of course are not ready for use, here is one of them:
[https://www.mediafire.com/file/snofar0e ... 2.wav/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/snofar0e6pyx1qk/000000a2.wav/file)

If someone could help me here it would be great, again I'm also not sure if I even unpacked these files correctly, needless to say I'm a complete ignoramus on the matter.

If you rename the files to *.at3 they will play in Foobar/vgmstream.

terrific, thanks! I also see I can use foobar to convert them, this was much less of a headache than I imagined.
