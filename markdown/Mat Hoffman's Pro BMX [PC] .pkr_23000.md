- Post Title: Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX [PC] *.pkr

Good day everyone, could you please help me unpack [this](https://mega.nz/file/lRd2CTJD#lYTfEv9UYER-ibGIlj77_1uP05btnr86aTnNq1RGUeg)? The format might be similar to [that](http://aluigi.zenhax.com/bms/wolverine_revenge.bms) (they even have the same header) but still a bit different so that the script doesn't work.

Also [this info](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=21715#p21715) could prove useful too.

Good luck with reversing this type of an archive.
Later!

Your files can be easily extracted\edited with PKR3 Editor [http://www.thps-mods.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=796](http://www.thps-mods.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=796)

I have also updated the Wiki for reference [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Mat_Ho ... ro_BMX_PKR](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Mat_Hoffman%27s_Pro_BMX_PKR)

Thanks but I'm still in a bit of a pickle here. I want to export whole folders or even all contents of a pkr at once but there's no such option.

I've just found out there's All.pkr Exporter/Importer (PKRRepack v1.1) & it has mass export feature but, alas, it only works with pkr2 files whereas I have pkr3.
And contacting Kamiloxnumetal at Thps-mods.com doesn't seem too fruitful too, he hasn't been around the forum for quite some time...

Bye!

There are no other custom tools for this file format as far as I know,
so you can use this editor or MultiEx BMS scripts which I have linked on the wiki.

Spider-Man 2000 uses the same format: [https://github.com/krystalgamer/spidey- ... /v2/v2.zip](https://github.com/krystalgamer/spidey-tools/releases/download/v2/v2.zip)

pkr.exe does exactly that.

Oh, it's good to know that. 

So I have updated the wiki [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Activision_PKR3](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Activision_PKR3)
