How's that for holy cow? I have this posted on 2 other forums and in a week no one's come close to guessing what it says. This is part of a new cypher I'm working on to go with my base-3 research and is a blend of base-2 (Binary) and base-3. I don't have anything to offer to anyone who figures it out.. Save for recognition of having figured out an impossible system with almost 2 million combinations 

Untill next time!

You're the first forum that bothered to ask for clues 

The first and last 2 fields are L and S
The Rows are F and G
L=A or B
S=C or D

S + L = F and/or G

The languages used are Binary (base-2) and my lovely little creation.. Trinary (the base-3 system)
