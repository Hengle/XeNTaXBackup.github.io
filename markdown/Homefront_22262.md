Hello. I was able to convert your files to some readable form.
Here are tools and documentation --> [https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools ... /Homefront](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/tree/master/NEW%20Tools/Homefront)

So extraction is possible. I hope that someone will help you with repacking.
