- Post Title: ARMA *.p3d/*.rtm/*.wrp

[https://mega.nz/folder/4KIWQJqZ#B6v_d13la7bHUmMbP3u7fQ](https://mega.nz/folder/4KIWQJqZ#B6v_d13la7bHUmMbP3u7fQ)
There was a program called Oxygen, which was used to create .P3D files in Bohemia Interactive games:


Also, *.wrp files were created with a terrain editor called Visitor.
They were both part of BI Tools (for ARMA: Armed Assault and its sequel) and an Operation Flashpoint tool suite called [Breathe](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.flashpoint1985.com/breathe/).

Anyone managed to import *.p3d/*.rtm files from ARMA games?
I tried hex2obj, but *.P3D files are compressed.
The Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis *.P3D loader module is already included in the 3D Object Converter.
