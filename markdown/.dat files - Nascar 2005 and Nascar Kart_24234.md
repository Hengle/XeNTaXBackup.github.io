Does anyone know how to unpack .dat files from NASCAR 2005 on the GameCube and NASCAR Kart on the Wii?
Samples are here

This script can extract data from those DAT samples

Also, we have some documentation for this file format on the wiki

Do these dat files have filenames or how is that handled?

There are no filenames in this type of archive. They are auto-generated by quickbms.


You can read more about this in quickbms documentation [http://aluigi.zenhax.com/papers/quickbms.txt](http://aluigi.zenhax.com/papers/quickbms.txt)

Also, always check the wiki first before asking.
