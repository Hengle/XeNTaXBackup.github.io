- Post Title: Mobile MT Framework .tex files (Have converted images)

Hello everybody,

E: See third post.

I hope somebody can help me with the following file format. The textures are from Monster Hunter 4, a Mobile MT Framework-based game by Capcom.
As with other MT Framework games, the textures are stored in .tex files but they seem to be different in comparison to other MT-games as no tool I tried could convert them.

I'd greatly appreciate any help. Here are quite a few example files for you: [http://www44.zippyshare.com/v/68034145/file.html](http://www44.zippyshare.com/v/68034145/file.html)

Thank you very much!

According to some left-over folder that slipped into the release build (its just simply named tga_out), the textures have been converted from tga. Maybe this helps.

I have acquired some converted png files and have combined them with the game .tex equivalents. Maybe it helps to analyze the image formats easier.
Please have a look!
