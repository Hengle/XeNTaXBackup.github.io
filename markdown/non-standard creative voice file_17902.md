- Post Title: non-standard creative voice file

Hi guys, I'm looking to play a ".snd" file, however it's actually an archive containing numerous snd files, which are actually creative sound voice files in disguise, so it neither plays as a standard snd file nor as a VOC.
This is the audio from the Knowledge Adventure game 3D Body Adventure.

Looking at it in a hex editor shows that it's a 'KA archive', shows a list of all the included 'snd' files, and then before the audio data is "Creative Voice File.....). ...KA ADPCM/HUFFMAN PACK".
I can provide the file if needed, I just really want to get a few tunes out of this.
