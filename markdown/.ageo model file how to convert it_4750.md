I explored the Dream Aquarium screensaver, found that the fish model was stored in .ageo file type, how to convert the beautiful fish into obj,3ds etc could be read in 3dsmax or maya?

After the first 4 bytes in the .ageo is a 4byte integer stating the number of vertexes in the file (staring from 0)....
The vertexes are stored in 80 byte arrays:
4BytefloatVertexes(X,Y,Z) Unknown8Bytes 4BytefloatTextureMappings(U,V) Unknown4Bytes 4ByteFloatNormalMappings(X,Y,Z) Unknown36Bytes

There is also a Face index list, where each face is either a Triangle or a Quad:
Triangles begin with: 01 03 00 00 00 followed by 4ByteIntegers(VertexA, VertexB, VertexC)
Quads begin with: 01 04 00 00 00 followed by 4ByteIntegers(VertexA, VertexB, VertexC, VertexD)

My quads the way I convert them don't work, so the underside of this crab has some open faces which should not be there.
