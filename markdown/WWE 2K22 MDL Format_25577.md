- Post Title: WWE 2K22 MDL Format

Hello, the WWE 2K mod community is searching for anyone who can produce an mdl format Blender script for the WWE 2K22 mdl format. 

We currently have a alpha script to import and export modded mdls, but so much is missing and the exported format is not 1:1.

We are looking for someone who can decipher and re-write at least the following from the mdl format:
1:1 Normals Calculation on Export
Shape Keys/Facial Animations
Custom Skeletons
There is a section of the mdl that defines championship belt size on the character.
LODs
Weapons/Props cannot be picked up if using modified MDL, therefore ruining the mod. Perhaps they have "sockets"?

WWE 2K Mod Community leader RipZz is offering financial compensation to anyone for their time working on this.

Below is a few sample MDLs

and attached to the post is the current Blender script + a below a link for CakeTools, if you own WWE 2K22 you can use it to extract more samples from the cak files.
