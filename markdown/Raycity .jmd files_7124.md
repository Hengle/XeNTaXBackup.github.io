- Post Title: Raycity *.jmd files

Hi!
I'm trying to get the models from the Raycity.
[http://raycity.pmang.com/](http://raycity.pmang.com/)
They are unknown models and *.DDS textures but they are packed inside *.jmd files.
I don't know how to extract *.jmd files.
Can someone make a bms script to unpacked those files?

Here are some jmd samples:

Thanks for reading.

fileinfo.0m is a binary xml format    they suck for a quick script.. 

strings are:
uint32 len
wchar_t str[len]

3 values are most likely include attributes and child count

afraid i don't have time to get further for now
