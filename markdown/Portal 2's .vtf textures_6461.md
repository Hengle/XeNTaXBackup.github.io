- Post Title: Portal 2's .vtf textures

I can't open Portal 2's .vtf textures..

Here's one from the PC version: [http://www.multiupload.com/JIK3LQ05YU](http://www.multiupload.com/JIK3LQ05YU)

I'd like to edit them in an image editor, but no plugin can load these new .vtfs...!

You have to hex edit the header with the file version. They are largely the same just need that change. After that everything can read them again.
