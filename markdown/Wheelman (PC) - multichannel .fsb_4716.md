You mind to unpack the 6 channels in one .wav/file? like ac3/aac/vorbis? 5.1 not in 3 stereo files?

No, I just want to extract all stereo files in their original format, i.e. three stereo IMA ADPCM files in this case. Exactly the same procedure as with multichannel MP3. Is there any possibility to do that?
