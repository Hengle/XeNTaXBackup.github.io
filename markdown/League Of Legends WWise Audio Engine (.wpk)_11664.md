- Post Title: League Of Legends WWise Audio Engine (.wpk)

Recently Riot Games announced they are changing to a new Audio Engine. They currently use FMOD, and for the longest time, I was able to use FSBEXT to Extract, Replace, and Re-compile sounds without any problems.

Digging through some of the files inside league of legends, I found a new folder called "WWISE" and figured this must be the new engine, inside the folder contained several files that i'm sure FSBEXT wont help any longer when the update goes live.

I did some research but couldn't find much about the extension (.wpk), The extension I found inside the folder "WWISE". Theres also another extension (.bnk) but these files are extremely small and I hardly doubt they hold the sound files i'm hunting for. I heard QUICKBMS could possibly help me with this situation, but after testing around with QUICKBMS for several days I got nothing.

If anyone can help me get this cracked open, able to replace the sounds, and then recompile them for the game, that would be awesome.

Audiokinetic Wwise .BNK and .PCK files are common, you can open them with Ravioli Game Tools. 

But .WPK? First time I've heard of it. Must be a new thing.

Alright after using Ravioli Game Tools, It appears I can open and view and even play the sounds inside the .wpk. Awesome! But I do not see a function anywhere to replace sounds and re-pack it,

Not possible. You can't repack stuff using the Wwise engine. 

You could theoretically repack it if you had all the filenames and licensed the software for thousands of dollars, but that's a bit of a stretch.

Darn.. Really? That makes me pretty sad that my mod that has been working for over 3 years is now seeing a grim death in the near future because of Wwise.

You've been working on a sound mod for three years?

yea, got a sound mod for League of Legends, have alot of users that use it, but since league is changing audio engines (Fmod to Wwise) I had to try to adapt, but i suppose thats not possible.
