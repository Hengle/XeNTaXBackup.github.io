How can I convert the models from these games? I've seen some MW3 models posted for garrysmod but found no tools or tutorials on how to do it yourself.

The Call of Duty devs are actually quite nice when it comes to modding. So far they're pretty much given you a full SDK for every game. 
However, I've only played COD 1-3, WaW, and BO1, so I have no idea what the situation is with the newer games. They may still do that, but who knows. 

I remember seeing a special BO2 extractor called Lime, you may want to search that.
