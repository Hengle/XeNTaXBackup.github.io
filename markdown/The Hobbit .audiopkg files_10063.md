- Post Title: The Hobbit *.audiopkg files

Hi,

I download a game called "The Hobbit". I completed it a few months ago. And I am interested in "How does this game work, then?", so I looked after the package formats. With Game Extractor I successfully unpacked all of the compressed directories. But in some of them, there are also packages with *.audiopkg extension. I think the vocals and musics are in these packages. They are also available from The Hobbit Demo without unpack any compressed directory. But I don't know how to open them. I uploaded some of them. Could anybody write a script to unpack them?

A snippet from the label shown up before running the game:

"Dolby, Pro Logic, (...) MPEG Layer-3 playback supplied with the Miles Sound System (...) MPEG Layer-3 audio compression technology licensed by Fraunhofer IIS and THOMSON multimedia (...)"

Does this mean anything about the audio compression?

My results about the content of the files:

Bytes from 0 to 3F are information about author, date, etc.
From A0 to A3 is the number of audio files are in the file. (There is also a value after this, which is the same).
From the block EC there are the name of an audio file in uppercase. They are divided by 0x00.

AND I AM NOT LOOKING FOR THE SOUNDTRACKS. EVERYBODY CAN FIND IT ON THE NET!
I am looking for the another audio content.

Could anybody find a solution for this problem?

Thanks!
