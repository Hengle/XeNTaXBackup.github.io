I've problem with alpha channels in Chaos;Child sprites, like this:


This sprite from chara.cpk package, there is .png sprite and .lay alpha-channel:
[https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=9 ... file%2cpng](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=908738660B3A7490!438&authkey=!AHIW3UN6q4EUdpc&ithint=file%2Cpng) - sprite
[https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=9 ... file%2clay](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=908738660B3A7490!437&authkey=!ALgdI00Z-gyWorQ&ithint=file%2Clay) - alpha-channel
