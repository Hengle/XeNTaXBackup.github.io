- Post Title: GHOST WARRIOR CONTRACTS

Hi all i am trying to view the 3d models in .cgf format from GHOST WARRIOR CONTRACTS 

i have successfully unpacked the object.pak files using winrar , and have all the dirs and model .cgfs themselves 

i have used noesis prog recently to view all the crysis 1 , 2 and 3 game engine models in .cgf, but noesis wont open the GHOST WARRIOR CONTRACTS .cgf model files ??

so basically i am stuck , i  have googled solutions and searched , can anyone help with this please ? , point me in the right direction to open and view the files , a noesis plugin or update ?

cheers
