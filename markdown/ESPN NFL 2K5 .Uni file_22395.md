Hi,Aluigi made a quickbms script to extract the files from the game mentioned in the title. I extracted the file and was left with these formats.

AIP .AUD .CAC .CRI .DRC .FON .HIL .HIS .HIT .ICO .LAY .MAN .MRK .PLA .ROS .SCN .SIT .TXT .TRI .UNI

I'm trying to extract the .uni files and need some help
