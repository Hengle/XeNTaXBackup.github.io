Why not just patch then extract the Pak? (per this thread: [viewtopic.php?f=21&t=11573](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=11573))

I'm interested in the old build. It can't be obtained via the launcher - it update to the latest version.

P.S. How do you do  with the Isolation?

i looked at the 1-to-63 example. 

the *.zip is a renamed EXE file. Created by [http://www.solidstatenetworks.com/](http://www.solidstatenetworks.com/), a company specializing in patching and deployment.

The *.z01 file is just a standard ZIP file. can be opened with Winzip, etc

As for Aliens, it's coming but just taking a break for the holidays.
