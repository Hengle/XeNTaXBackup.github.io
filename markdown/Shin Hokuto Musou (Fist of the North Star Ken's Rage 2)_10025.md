Hi chrrox, your quickbms script work with the xbox version. Thank you so much 
I can be able to view the models in Noesis. However I can not view the texture with model EVEN when I copy the .G1T files and put them into the same folder as the model .bin files.
Do you know What I did wrong? or is there a script to get the .dds files out of the .G1T files? 

Thank you

Hi chrrox.

I can loaded all the character's models on Noesis, but I haven't try the scene or items yet.
This is what its looks like:
[](http://postimage.org/image/95nix4aj5/)
I use your ps3 script on the file calls "LINKDATA.A". After that I found the character's models inside a folder Action (DATA\PS3\Action\model).

For the Xbox script, I try it and again I copy the texture files (.G1T) into the model folder.
And its work! I can view the model as well as the texture in Noesis. Thank you chrrox 
[](http://postimage.org/image/a90caswff/)

However, I can only view the model that under 1,000KB of size. Any files that over 1,000KB will crashed the Noesis (I am using Noesis version 4.03, I think this is the newest one) . so I can only view the hands, some weapons and Items. No character model is loaded. 
[](http://postimage.org/image/g7e5l1fe3/)

This is the example of many files that crashed, and I think this is a character file. I have a character calls "Rihaku" here, Inside the zip file I have the .bin and .g1t files.

Thank you again for your work  I am a fan of Fist of the North Star and per-order this game almost at day one. The extractable character models would be a plus for me.  
Thank you

they compressed some models.
you have to decompress them with offzip.
also the model format has changed a little in the main folder.
you can view the event models no problem.

Thanx Chrrox!
Hope you can fix it soon for 360.
Will this script also extract also linkdata.b and link data.c ?

Is it possible also to recompress again the lnkdata archives after cahnging some files?
Thanx

Hi Chrrox 

I just got the PS3 Version today so I try the ps3 files with your script.
Its seem that all the files can not be open/preview with the Noesis program at all.
When I click on the file in Noesis, Noesis said that "File could not be previewed".

SO, I wonder that your Hokuto Musou PS3 Version is work with your script and you can able to view the models with the texture right?
If yes, then I much did something wrong...therefore here are the stpes that I did:
1. I copy the LINKDATA.A file from PS3 BR-disc onto a folder at my desktop.
2. Using the QuickBMS 0.5.15b + Chrrox PS3 script on the LINKDATA.A file. 
3. After extracted into many files and folders, I goto the textures folder(DATA\PS3\Action\texture) and copy all the .g1t files into the the model folder(DATA\PS3\Action\model) which had the .bin files inside.
4. Then I open the Noesis v392 and go into the model folder and try to preview the .bin model. but the Noesis said that "File could not be previewed".

Hmm..am I doing this the right way? Also this is the example of the .bin file and .g1t file that I extracted:
This is Souther Damage model: [http://www.mediafire.com/?39a4q8ccrvdazft](http://www.mediafire.com/?39a4q8ccrvdazft)

Thank you so much Chrrox for you help
I am so looking forward. Thank

Has anyone figured out how to open the textures correctly?
When I try to load a model with its textures Noesis crashes, I also tried another way to extract dds images from g1t files, but nothing good!
