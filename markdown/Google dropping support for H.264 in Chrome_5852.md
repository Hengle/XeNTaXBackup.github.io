- Post Title: Google dropping support for H.264 in Chrome

Warning: link hell ahead...  

Google [announced last week](http://blog.chromium.org/2011/01/html-video-codec-support-in-chrome.html) that it is dropping support for the [H.264 (MPEG-4)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC) video codecs in Google Chrome. As a result of that, the [Free Software Foundation](http://fsf.org) [signed up](http://www.fsf.org/news/supporting-webm) as a [supporter of the WebM Project](http://www.webmproject.org/about/supporters/#foundations). I think it'd be pretty cool for the Xentax Foundation to get behind this too; does anyone else have any thoughts on it?
