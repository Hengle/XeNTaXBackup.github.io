I managed to download the Soft-Launch on Windows 10 and the models are in .jmodel, textures in .jtex and animations in .janim

Here is some samples of the Lancer EVO if anyone is interested: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/ga4inz6alx46g ... s.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ga4inz6alx46gnn/samples.zip?dl=0)
