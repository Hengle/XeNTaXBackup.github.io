- Post Title: .VEH .CAM or .GEN encrypted

Hi everyone ,

i do cars render on  with 3ds  max .The game is rFactor 2 .In the folder game ,ISI gave us a "MAS TOOL" to open the .MAS files .With some cars , i have no problems but with other i have error message saying "unvalid key MAS".
I use 3Dsimed to open all the GMT file opened with MAS tool 

3dsimed imported GMT or VEH files:


With 3d simed after the GMT files has imported in . I export the textures (dds files) and the 3d in a DAE file that after i import in 3DS .

There is a solution for crypted files ?

In advance thanks
