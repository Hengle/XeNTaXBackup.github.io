[viewtopic.php?f=21&t=5899](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=5899)

This is a bms script for those archives
Run it on fileindex.msf in the main folder to unpack everything.

Some discussion on it. May be useful.

This format stores normals and UV's with the faces.

I either need to figure out how to do immediate mode rendering properly, or convert per-face to per-vertex.
