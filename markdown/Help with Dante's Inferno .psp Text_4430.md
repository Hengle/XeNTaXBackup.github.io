- Post Title: Help with Dante's Inferno .psp Text

Well. I'm trying to translate this game, i already found the game texts.. they're inside a container.


Here's what i find out so far about the file:

At the offset 220 there is the number of files inside the container.
At the offset 224 there is the starting position of the pointers to the files.
At the offset 414 there is a size check (size opf the file).

Sorry.. i'm a newbie at this stuff, so if anyone can help me i would aprecciate. 

Thanks for the time.

Man, i'm sorry, i forgot about that!

I will post late.!

EDIT:

The specs are the same as these:

At the offset 220 there is the number of files inside the container.
At the offset 224 there is the starting position of the pointers to the files.
At the offset 414 there is a size check (size of the file).

I was having trouble cuz my tool was doing some thing wrong when rebuilding the file.
