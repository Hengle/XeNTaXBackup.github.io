Hello, I need help decrypting these .sps files
Nothing is encrypted in your files, almost every single audio format NFS series games have are now supported by the vgmstream dev team, and have been fully reversed, and if you use foobar2000/vgmstream combo your files will play just fine, except those with the missing header like in your GELDY_UI_STREAMS.zip, you'll have to hunt for the missing headers/metadata information yourself, their hidden among those BNDL archives, good luck.
