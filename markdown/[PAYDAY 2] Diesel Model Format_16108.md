- Post Title: [PAYDAY 2] Diesel Model Format

Hey, so, the PAYDAY 2 modding community has reached the point where we're doing shit like adding entirely new weapons and cops to the game, but we've hit a small snag. Nobody understands how the model format works well enough to make a proper model compiler for it. All we have are research notes and a tool that can sort-of properly compile a model, but it only has one bone maximum and no weighting or anything. This is cool for level geometry or props, but not-so-cool for stuff like custom cop models, which is what we'd like to use it for.

I asked around, and heard you guys are really good at reverse engineering just about everything when it comes to video games, so I figured I'd post what we've assembled here and see if you guys can make anything of it.

Crap, thanks for letting me know, thought it was okay because of the porn game thread with the bounty.
