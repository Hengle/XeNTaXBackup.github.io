Hello,

I'm trying to access the game's audio files inside the IMG_DB.BIN file. So that I can replace them with other audio files and then recompress them into a new IMG_DB.BIN file. Can you help me? Thank you very much.

Image Contents for Fatal Frame 1 are the following: [https://imgur.com/a/EFPKrwI](https://imgur.com/a/EFPKrwI)

Would appreciate help - thank you very much.

On zenhax I asked but the admin said he doesn't know how to do it: [https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t= ... 669#p62255](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=14585&p=67669#p62255)

I tried this tool: [https://github.com/wmltogether/ZeroUnpacker](https://github.com/wmltogether/ZeroUnpacker)

From CMD I get this:

deless.exe IMG_BD.BIN
ELESSHeader: Bad LESS signature

Maybe I need to write different commands?

This error message "Bad LESS signature" suggests that your file may be not supported.
Maybe try it with file from different region (USA, EUR or JPN).
