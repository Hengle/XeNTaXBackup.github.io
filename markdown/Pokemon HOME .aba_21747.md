- Post Title: Pokemon HOME .aba

Pokemon HOME has a audio file format called .aba to me this looks like a UnityFS file, but partially encrypted or obfuscated. It reminds me of the Animal Crossing Pocket Camp encryption where its a rolling XOR the first 0x200 and then every 0x100. But I cannot seem to reuse my same code

Were there any 3D models in Pokémon HOME?
