- Post Title: What about a runtime model ripper? (info inside)

So, since we have xbox 360 SDK and we can get xbox executables to run in the background as plugins, why not make a model ripper that works in real time? like most pc model extractors do, so you go to the game, press a combination of buttons and then it starts copying the gpu info to a model on the hard drive.
Also with rgloader and teamxecuter fusion we can actually get data from any instruction from the pc even kernel level, so that could also be a way using the xbox libraries.

So, is it possible to do this?
