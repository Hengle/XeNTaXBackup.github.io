just replace RSA KEY, you can find it in sekiro.exe, just open it and search it.

then copy
BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
???
-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY

to [https://github.com/Atvaark/BinderTool/b ... ionKeys.cs](https://github.com/Atvaark/BinderTool/blob/master/BinderTool/DecryptionKeys.cs)
and you will be fine. main file system is not change, you can also reuse darksouls code.

only change is decompression algorithm, from zlib to Kraken(oo2core_6_win64.dll)

Everything seems to work already.
I didn't check most of the files, though - just a main hero.
