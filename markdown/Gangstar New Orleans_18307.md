Info about the game: Windows Store game: [https://www.gangstarneworleans.com/](https://www.gangstarneworleans.com/)



After you downloaded it, follow the next site to pinpoint the downloaded files: [https://www.intowindows.com/how-to-acce ... indows-10/](https://www.intowindows.com/how-to-access-windowsapps-folder-in-windows-10/)

You'll find the packages in a folder similar to this one: C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\A278AB0D.GangstarNewOrleans_1.2.6.4_x86__h6adky7gbf63m\data\packages

They are compressed vArc files that can be extracted via the bms script called VisionPackage_vArc.bms.
