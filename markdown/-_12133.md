Bump here too   
I've tried to rip with ripper programs and can get only textures but not the mesh, it can be really really good if someone make something to extract the content those models have better quality in terms of poly and textures because i've take a look on GT for PSP and this one have less poly and crappy textures, Sega GT 2002/Online are better at all but those Genki games are a lot better and have really nice models like the Mirage or Levin 2 Door.
