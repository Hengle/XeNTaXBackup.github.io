- Post Title: New Project for Mr.Mouse

So, I've conquered the world of Unreal 2 and moved on to more painfull tasks.  Like figuring out how to open the sally_clean.bf file found in UbiSoft's wonderful release of Beyond Good & Evil.
Many people have come to me saying "Use bfextract !"  Yet, much NOT to my surprise... none of them know how to use it(not that i have found anyways).
I try to use the program and it just pops up then disappears.  I try to "open with" then select the bfextract... same thing.
I'm still working on getting input from people on this but i was wondering if Mr.Mouse could hve a look-see.  If you dont have the Sally_clean.bf file from the game, i would be more than happy to supply it if permitted.
anyhow, back to figuring out what i can figure out.

I was wondering if it's possible to integrate the bfextract work into the your program.  Also, i have extracted the wad files from the bf file and cant seem to open/edit them with any of the typical wad programs(Wally, QXT, etc..)
If anyone decides to give it a go, let me know what program you use for these particular wad files.
Any help is very much appreciated.
Thanks guys,

Okay, I will try to see what this is about, if the sally_xx.bf file is not too big you could try and upload it here (attach it). But at the moment, due to moving, I have not yet got cable internet back, just a 56k modem, so I won't be doing much downloading until I have that back, which I expect during the next two weeks.

I hope the moving has gone well.  Sorry to hear about the 56k, i remember those day and would do anything not to go back to them.  As for the Sally_xx.bf file.... well.... it's 95% of the game files and it's about 1.1g's.
Honestly, unless you feel like beating up your brain, I would just have to say that this one is a lost cause.  It seems that they have compressed all map, character, etc textures/files ... the sounds and so forth, all into this one huge file.  The game is awesome.  It may have only taken me less than a straight 24 hours to beat, but the game is just great.  No one has managed to redo any maps, skins, etc.  because of the horrific file.  I would love to do models for the game... but it's seemingly impossible.
All in all i must say... don't bother yourself with this if it's going to be more difficult of a task than you care to deal with.
either which way, anything you can come up with would be very much appreciated.
TY Mr.Mouse for your time.

sounds for me like its some MS DOS program. jsut start the windows command prompt and then open the file there.  start->accessoires-> command prompt. or something like that

I have working copies of the program used to open the .bf files, it has an interface to it and can extract files out of the .bf file.  it's not very handy i must say.  it was only really made to extract the sound files out of sally_clean.bf so that people could get the soundtrack from the game.
i'm not certain if i kept them after i formatted my drive, so i will have to check.  if i kept them i will post them on here so that you guys can have a look-see for yourselves.

much appreciation Sir Mouse
I have come to find that 2 of Ubisoft's games use the .bf file format and am willing to bet the rest of their newer games also use it.  I believe either Soldner or Something-a-rather:Typhoon Rising(one of thos is an Ubisoft game) use the same type of file.  I figure someone can crunch this .bf file format problem, i can begin making skins/models for all 3 games(Beyond Good & Evil, Prince of Persia, and one of the two previously stated games)
which would be awesome.  Take your time sir and as always i appreciate your time.
