- Post Title: Vanguard Zero: Encrypted AssetBundle file that can't be opened using AssetStudio or other usual methods (UABE etc)

I can open and extract assets from other files in the game folders, but this one file can't be opened at all. Here's the file in question: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QyaSKp ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QyaSKpIYQugyMeikf1AzwkEjd49ySx25/view?usp=sharing)
I guess it contains the correct name for other files in the AssetBundle files since it's in the same folder as them (that's why it's encrypted), which can be used to pinpoint which file contains which asset since outside the AssetBundle files I can open are only named in hashes.
Any help would be appreciated, and here's the link for other AssetBundle files from the game that I can open too: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DYL2EoJ7Jdt6vt2FDk1aN7dA6ix-hVoE?usp=sharing)
