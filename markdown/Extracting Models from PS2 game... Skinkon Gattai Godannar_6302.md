- Post Title: Extracting Models from PS2 game... Skinkon Gattai Godannar

Hey everybody,
I just recently got a PS2 game that has some AWESOME mech models in it... called Shinkon Gattai Godannar, based on the series by the same name. I mounted the game, and found a selection of files:
AFS.LST
DATA.AFS
SADX.AFS
BOOT.PAC
SFD.AFS
and some other associated files that are obviously not models. Given my experience with this setup, I figured the DATA.AFS holds the models- so I extracted it. I found a bunch of files inside, all with the extension .pac.
I have heard that this is a virtual format, with no generic base, and I have looked at various .pac extractors in an attempt to open them. Can anyone help me figure this out? I am looking for the models of the robots in the series, which I think are packed, with their textures, in the .pac files.
There are several different name bases for these files:
ed_chXX.pac (I think these are cutscenes)
stXX_XXX.pac
st_XXX.pac
vs_XX.pac (I think these are levels, but not sure)

Any ideas?
Thanks

Yo, is is this still active? I'd love for anything to get those sweet Shizuru models.
