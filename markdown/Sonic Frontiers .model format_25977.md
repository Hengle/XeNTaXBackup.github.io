- Post Title: Sonic Frontiers .model format

Sonic Frontiers uses a simular format to Sonic Forces, but the existing tools are unable to import its models.

I have checked a few models and going by headers there are two types of model file:
One with "NEDARCV1 arc NEDLDIV1lodinfo NEDMDLV5model" in the header
Another with "Model NodesExt NodePrms SCAParam ShadowCa ShadowRe GIOcclus TerrainB ColorMas CyberMas"

I have not found any tools to import the former.
The latter can be imported using Turk645's blender importer, but the imported models look to be missing meshes.

Looks as if it were a matter of FVFsizes, so fixing scripts should not be too hard - I thought:

H2O file for the body:

0x1244D6 22947
Vb1
44 24
0x12F81C 5362
120100
0x0 255

(44 being the FVFsize here, just in case)
-------------------------

edit: the script finds below 6 parts, but the body (verts at 0x12F81C) is missing, will need some effort to get an idea, why:

1) params: 0x32cc
verts: 0x8dd8
2) params: 0x205c0
verts: 0x37d8c
3) params: 0xae174
verts: 0xae9f4
4) params: 0xb0f98
verts: 0xb1c2c

5) params: 0xb9790  hands ("chr_eggman_cloth")
verts: 0xc9f58

6) params: 0x106574
verts: 0x10770c

Now I understand: magic tables are horrible. 30% of H2O files need fixing. Annoying.

I don't know much about this topic, but its interesting that the amy .model file has extra code in the header, but looking a little lower it has a similar bit of code to sage's .model file.
I've been doing some texting importing them to blender and the .model files that have a header of "Model NodesExt NodePrms SCAParam ShadowCa ShadowRe GIOcclus TerrainB ColorMas CyberMas" can be imported just fine. The problem seems to be with any model with a header of "NEDARCV1 arc NEDLDIV1lodinfo NEDMDLV5model", these files seem to be offset in some way, and viewing a couple of them they all have the same amount of extra code in the header.

But that  doesn't matter in case you do a pattern search to get the meshes.

Now that the models can be obtained, I'm going to post on how to get the textures, so that the process of ripping Sonic Frontiers is faster.
The texture can be fixed using Skyth Tools (GitHub). After fixing the textures, I recommend using paint.net to view the dds files since a lot of them use a newer dds format (that gimp and photoshop can't open by default), and convert them to png.

yeah, someone needs to put the textures onto the models:
