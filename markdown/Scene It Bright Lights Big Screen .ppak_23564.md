- Post Title: Scene It Bright Lights Big Screen .ppak

Hello,

This game initially consists of various .pak files which can be extracted using quickbms (tongas).
This reveals a number of traditional files (.wav files, .ogg files, .swf files) but the files I'm most interested in are inside .ppak files

These ppak files are a bit of an enigma to me and I'm not sure what exactly I'm looking at - it is some kind of compressed(?) lookup table for the questions and answers, but I cannot make sense of it.

Perhaps somebody here can?

Thanks
