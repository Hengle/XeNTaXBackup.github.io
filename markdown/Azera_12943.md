Don't extract the .model files, it is a wrong way.

I uploaded the latest 3D Object Converter version to my web page (unpublished yet officially), it will help to you:

ummm many interesting Karpaty, what about batch export to psk? I see you don't have implemented it, if you convert to OBJ the model have very low details and ofc for tool is not registered the model was fucked.

The .obj format does not reduce the detail of the model. The .model and the exported .obj format use same triangles.

Hi guys. i'm interested in loading model + anim from this game. I've seen that the format is the samo as Warlord Online (.model and .ani).
I use warlord online importer ( included in FatImporter) to load mesh and ani but when i try to import them in 3dstudio max8 nothing happen ( no error no model, nothing...) I want to understand if the problem regard my old version of 3dstudio max... I've uploaded a unpacked folder ( with bms script) which contains .model .ani and .xml, pls try with your 3dsmax version

what's the output in the maxscript listener window?

I'm too lazy to search for that importer, but the mesh format is simple:

the problem is that i've no output! fatimporter works perfectly and when it doesn't succed to import I got a message of error. The problem is that this time,when i try to import a model I got neither message nor model.


here the link for fatimporter [http://www.mediafire.com/download/a3ywr ... r_2014.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/a3ywrmqrj42dzqc/FatImporter_2014.rar)

Model format is not complex, but my aim are animation

For the .model I get a "WGTH size error" (weights?) but it's hard to understand fatduck's cryptical scripts.
(Also I think he wouldn't be amused in case someone edited them.)

If you provided a WarLord online .model file I maybe could tell more.

It's not the same game, Warlord online 워로드 was published by pmang/neowiz and only launched in korea. If you find a client, you either are korean or you had it on your hdd already, trying to find it for months and no alive mirrors whatsoever.

have some differences
Maybe I'll create some maxscript from scratch for Azera (next year).

I'm at the very beginning. If you've already finished your script there's no need for me to continue (since I'm a very lazy person...  )

Thank you   - what I meant was that I'm not solving problems "in depth" whilst you, chrrox, MrAdults 
and other experts try to do a more or less complete format analysis.

Is there a way to convert the .dlb files to text? Just to find out what textures are used.

Because the textures for the various model parts are not always where you would expect e.g Sorceress Hair 07 is found in the Archer folder under HR_N_01

Thanks
