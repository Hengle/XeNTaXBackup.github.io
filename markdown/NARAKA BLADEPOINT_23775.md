But the models in the game have very high quality.

I know it's probably hopeless but no harm in asking I guess, but did anyone have any luck with models or a script to get them unpacked?

There is a free demo available at the moment and the "common_character_res" file inside "NarakaBladepoint_Data\StreamingAssets\c\o" is most likely where the characters are stored but not AssetStudio nor UABE can decompress it. I think Genshin Impact has similar encryption but I'm not sure.

i'd suggest to upload a small sample of the file so people can take a look at it, not everyone willing to download the full game demo just to take a look at the file except they're interested in the game itself

I'd like to bump this. Seemingly, it's also impossible to rip the models using NinjaRipper or RenderDoc, as the game has a rather strict anti-cheat system that prevents hooking the game executable.

EDIT: I was able to hook Intel GPA successfully by setting the GPA settings to auto-detect, luckily. However, it seems like the meshes are in a lot of parts, so it might be difficult to rip them this way.

I managed to hook Ninja Ripper onto it by attaching it to Steam and then booting the game instead of going for the game's executable right away but for some reason the meshes are posed.



UVs seem fine when imported into Max with GIMS Evo, but the model is still posed.

Hi
Can you share your modified assetStudio ? 
In my country, so many gamedev-studios respect this game, AAA quality graphic made by Unity engine. 
So I want to know how to make skin, hair like them

As of version 2022-06-24-21-40 there are two modifications to the [format](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Unity_Unity3d_UnityFS#Format_Specifications) as far as I can tell:
 - There is a custom signature of "15 1E 1C 0D 0D 23 21", this should be "UnityFS"
 - Both info block data sizes have been increased by 202, this needs subtracting

Reversing these changes will make a valid AssetBundle. See below for proof of concept and AssetStudio modifications for the info block data sizes.

It works, nice. Now I can pretty much just do a hex replacement from the signature with any hex editor but I have no idea if the same is possible when it comes to hex math in specific positions of the file, I manually changed the files inside ~/NarakaBladepoint_Data\StreamingAssets\c\o\ and all of them worked but there are aroun 1.4k files that need to be modified the same way, just need to know how to substract 202 dec (CA hex) from all those files in positions 28h-29h and 44h-45h

Hello! I've been following this thread for a while. I've ripped most everything with Ninja ripper but came across the same issues discussed prior and dealt with it the best that I could! Ripping the files via AS would be so much easier and less of a headache. 

I've never modified Asset Studio before, but I'm obv willing to try. I have notepad++ and peeked at the bundlefile.cs but it seems different than what was showcased in Barncastle's screenshot at what I think is the same block. For reference I've included a screenshot, and I made sure I was using the same version of AS as in the screenshot, which is 0.16.0 just to ensure there were not issues with using a more up to date version. 

I am also not understanding "- There is a custom signature of "15 1E 1C 0D 0D 23 21", this should be "UnityFS"" < this bit here! Some additional insight would be nice, thank you!

To recompile AS just for this is an option but also you can just use a hex editor to manually make a few changes to the files that need it and it would work with the regular AS, I think someone more familiar with quickbms could come up with a simple script for this.

I can try my hand at the hex editor with the NBP files and see if I can get it work. I will just quietly pray that someone familiar with QuickBMS will write a script kjhjgjg TY!

Something like this would do. File can be converted in both ways, it will be detected automatically based on current header. You need to run quickbms with -w option, because script is modifying files themselves. 

Update: Script is updated to skip incompatible files, you can use it on the whole game folder now. Though if you've already converted some files there, output will be mixed, so it's better to start with unmodified files.

Hey, thank you all for the info provided, things also seem to be working nicely using @Spiritovod's script, but something weird happens to AssetStudio when loading some files. It creates a memory leak somewhere and AssetStudio crashes after using 100% of my RAM, no matter how big/small the file is. Here's a problematic file for example: [https://pixeldrain.com/u/uMXJGmkn](https://pixeldrain.com/u/uMXJGmkn) (from /a/2) vs a file that loads normally from the same folder [https://pixeldrain.com/u/c7wXi6xF](https://pixeldrain.com/u/c7wXi6xF). So I have been cherry-picking what folders to load/etc. Did anybody encounter this?

I managed to load most of the files just fine, but I had to keep clicking on the prompt constantly as the tool fails to load the game's material files, although I did get my files from the Game Pass version instead of Steam's. However, while I have found some of the character models I wanted, I'm having some trouble finding other models and textures, especially the faces seem to be mostly missing; For example, I found the model files for Yoto Hime's default costume at .../7/c, but I can't find her face model nor the textures for that costume despite having loaded all the A, B, C... and 1, 2, 3... files. The files in the folders with hashed names also can't be loaded even after the script processes them, some even make the CMD freeze indefinitely.

The FBX export works just fine, you just need to export the textures separately.

This happens to me as well, but haven't tried with the game pass version files (super weird if there's an actual difference). I haven't looked much into what assets exist since my AssetStudio is going insane as I described before and as I want to load everything and then filter things out, I got lazy loading folders manually by what loads correctly and what doesn't.

I also found some interesting TextAssets (inside /f/a) that seem to contain juicy info but they are encoded, and decoding those is what I'm pursuing right now. The first few bytes of the file is the actual file name, with the bytes shifted, but I am currently stuck in decoding this format. I attached a screenshot and one of the files in the archive in case somebody more knowledgeable wants to tackle decoding them.

I managed to avoid the error messages using older versions of AS, I'm on the latest 15x version and it works fine, also I think both male and female models are just one base model modified via bonescaling/morphs there is just one base female and one base male, body and face are separated.

Tried out version 15.37 and it loaded way faster, but the textures for the default costumes I'm looking for are still missing, pretty sure they are in the files inside the hashed folders. The base body and face models don't seem to have any morphs or face bones but I think you're right to claim they are using the same faces albeit slightly tweaked across multiple characters.

Do you have a video showing how to make AS read the files in the game's StreamingAcess folder. I'm not an expert in this field so I don't really understand, I'm looking to get the skins to make mod material for some other games.

Here's what I've gathered.

1. Download/extract QuickBMS. [http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)
2. Download/extract Spritovod's script on page 2. Paste the .bms file into your quickbms folder.
3. Find the Naraka file you want to convert and paste it into the quickbms folder.
4. Open a command prompt, navigate to the quickbms folder, and type the following command: quickbms.exe -w naraka_convert.bms <Naraka file name>
5. The Naraka file is now modified and openable in AssetStudio.

On that note, does anyone know where the audio files might be located?

Edit: I found the "Audio" folder, lol. Wonder if there's a way to extract .bnk files with meaningful file names.

Thank you so much. I've tried and had to convert each file, if I want to convert an entire directory, what script can I replace?

Hello and thank you so much for all of the info so far. I am struggling with what I THINK is getting the script to work as intended. I run it, but it gives me 

```
- 0 files found in 0 seconds
  coverage file 0     0%   46         1367168    . offset 0000002e
```


and I am still unable to view anything in AssetStudio. Am I missing something? Any insight as to be sure I am running the scrip correctly? I am using the method above with using command prompt to with, for example, quickbms -w naraka_convert.bms FILENAME- and am just getting nowhere.

It's kinda dumb, but this is normal behavior in such cases. Even with "0 files found" message, your files would be already converted if proper syntax is used - for example, to convert the whole folder with subfolders, it's enough to use: 
quickbms_4gb_files.exe -w naraka_convert.bms "C:\Path to input folder"

Thankfully, you can't break files with multiple conversions, they will be just converted back to original state and vice versa. You can check current state of any file by opening it in hex editor, if it starts with UnityFS - it was already processed, otherwise convert it again.

I’ll try that again then! I didn’t use the 4gb version so maybe that’s my issue. I looked at the one I ran through vs the same file someone previously posted that works and mine did not convert previously- so I was assuming it was a me thing  

*edit* I could hug you! thank you- that was it

As of version 2022-06-24-21-40 there are two modifications to the format as far as I can tell:
 - There is a custom signature of "15 1E 1C 0D 0D 23 21", this should be "UnityFS"
 - Both info block data sizes have been increased by 202, this needs subtracting

Reversing these changes will make a valid AssetBundle. See below for proof of concept and AssetStudio modifications for the info block data sizes.

Sorry to bother you, but it seems they updated the encode method to encrypt the assets bundle, the header of the bundle didn't follow the format of UnityFS anymore as shown in the figure. Is there any way to figure out how to decrypt it? Thx!

Looks like you might be looking in one of the hashed folders maybe? I’m unsure if anyone has found the way inside of those yet. As of today the folders with 1 2 3.. a b c.. are still working as before. The ones with longer names are what I think are the hashed folders- if anyone has figured those out, I’d love to know!

Yes, and I think maybe some additional models like common hair and face are inside this file.

Yeah- I poked around in the folders and all of the hashed ones look different as far as the hex side of things go- there were a couple files strewn in there that the script did work for, none were for hair though. I couldn’t begin to guess which would be where hair is stored but maybe if you upload the suspected file- someone with big brain can look into it.

Thanks a lot for the bms script provided by Spiritovod, I also managed to extract most of the model of the game. But the faces and hair of the characters, etc. I searched all the documents and couldn't find them. So I'm hoping someone can figure out a way to open these hashed files, any help would be greatly appreciated!

I was able to see the hair in previous versions of the game, however in order to do so I had to open the WHOLE folder (NarakaBladepoint_Data) with AS after using the bms script to modify the headers of all the files, this way AS seems to link all the files in a way that made other assets available, I wanted to confirm this with newer versions of the game but AS crashes as the game grew too much and my PC has not enough RAM to handle it now (only 34GB).

If you know how to use DepotDownloader you can try to download previous versions of the game from Steam and check it out on your end.

I used bms to modify all the files in the <NarakaBladepoint_Data> folder according to the method you said (although some problems were encountered in the process, such as when those hash files were modified with bms, the cmd would be stuck and it must be Restart cmd to return to normal, and bms did not modify those hash files successfully). Still, I tried loading only the files 0, 1, 2, 3...a, b, c, etc. into AS, but that still filled my computer's memory. It seems that my computer's memory (64G) is not enough either.
Thanks for this method!

yeah, the bms script gets stuck for me too whne I use it like that so the way I do it now is to use a hex editor to locate only the files with the specific header that needs to be modified to create a list that is then used to create a batch file that will call quickbms.exe to modify each file, one at a time per line of the list so it doesnt gets stuck in the middle somewhere. I'm still not sure why the cmd line gets stuck in the middle of searching for which files to modify.

I've updated the script with additional check, it will now process only compatible files, so you can use it on the whole game folder. Though it's better to check if you have all files unmodified before doing so, otherwise you may get mixed output - since the script can automatically convert compatible files in both directions, already converted ones would be re-converted back to original state.

I found the way around the memory limitation and the hairs:



naraka.jpg (201.09 KiB) Viewed 6525 times



All I did was to manually activate the page file in Windows and set the lower and upper limit to something ludicrous like 256GB, then I used AS to load the whole NarakaBladepoint_Data folder, it took between 15-20 mins to load everything and the final memory usage was an impressive 148GB (4GB Windows system, 24GB RAM and 120GB of virtual memory (page file)), so unless you have a PC with around 128GB+ of RAM you can use this method to load the whole game, AS will map/link all the files and expose stuff that doesn't show up when you load individual files, I'm still investigating if this includes the files that have no Unity header.

The funny thing is that I had Windows 10 using the dynamic page file allocation thinking it would automatically use/increase the page file on it's own but it didn't and it was causing the PC to crash/freeze, so . . . yeah, screw you Micro$oft!

This method can be used to accomplish the same for the MiHoyo games and the custom version of AS that exclusively loads/decrypts the assets of those games (HI3, GI, SR, ZZZ, ToT, etc.)

Cheers

Do you mean to set enough virtual memory? In addition, the hair in the picture is not what I want, because this hair belongs to a special character's hair, so I can also see him in a separate file.

Yeah, just set upwards of 128GB of virtual memory and AS should have no problem loading all the assets.

Managed to get most of the files and stuff working thanks to the script and advice in here, but also having issues with hair. Seems like with the exception of Yotohime, all the hair files are stored in a .json format. (e.g. hair_xx_mesh_data.json) I could be totally wrong about this since I'm new to a lot of this and been struggling my way through porting stuff, but I'm at a loss here for how to convert them into something usabl if this is the case.

Thanks to this thread I've been able to load a majority of folders with high return rates on assets!! I''ve moved on to exporting models and reapplying their textures. Most of the textures are suffixed with an underscore--letter(s) i.e., _d, _e, _n... etc. I've discerned that d= diffuse/ basic color map | e = overlay for d | n = normal | but there's one that's suffixed _mrav that I don't know where it falls when adding nodes to generate the intended effect. 

Any help is much appreciated!

@yureha: MRA usually stands for metallic / roughness / ambient occlusion (per channel). Not sure about last component, if any, it can be anything without knowing context.

About how to find what file is you want, just open it,and search keyword.
There is a tool can be helpful: FileLocator Pro
It can search from a folder, and show all files result.

Because the face mesh cannot be obtained by decompression, my current method is to intercept the face mesh through ninja and then manually stitch it on the body in blender to get a complete character. Because the facial makeup in the game is superimposed and mixed through multiple mask textures, so my method can only restore the effect of the game as much as possible, and cannot restore 100%.

I can't seem to get Ninja Ripper to work with blade point, but that might be because I'm using the Xbox App version. How'd you get ninja ripper to work with it?

Just follow the usage method of Ninja Ripper (the version of Ninja Ripper is the latest version), and then use a PC game client (Steam or Epic).

Are you extracting them correctly? I ssume you are getting the FBX files out using AssetStudio, you need to select the whole branch where the hair is located in the Scene Hierarchy tab to get the bones, otherwise it will just extract the mesh:

Do you have a video showing how to make AS read the files in the game's StreamingAcess folder. I'm not an expert in this field so I don't really understand, I'm looking to get the skins to make mod material for some other games.


Here's what I've gathered.

1. Download/extract QuickBMS. http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm
2. Download/extract Spritovod's script on page 2. Paste the .bms file into your quickbms folder.
3. Find the Naraka file you want to convert and paste it into the quickbms folder.
4. Open a command prompt, navigate to the quickbms folder, and type the following command: quickbms.exe -w naraka_convert.bms <Naraka file name>
5. The Naraka file is now modified and openable in AssetStudio.

On that note, does anyone know where the audio files might be located?

Edit: I found the "Audio" folder, lol. Wonder if there's a way to extract .bnk files with meaningful file names.

I write a simple tool to extract audio or modify audio for .bnk files,need to install python3.7.x to run it.
here is the github: 
[https://github.com/airdest/SoundBankModifier](https://github.com/airdest/SoundBankModifier)

and here is some note about Wwise SoundBank audio format,may could help you:

Wow cant belive i got it to work.

I can confirm that it still works with newest game version (Steam, pre-F2P patch) with the guide and script in this tread.
Inused assetstudio 15.41 or something because it takes way less time that the newest! 

For annyone thats new to AsseetStudio that wants rigged moddels: make sure check the files in Scene Hierarchy and dont select L1-L3 as these are „unnecessary“ LOD meshes. 
So select all the ones you want to export and then export selected through the dropdown menu seperate or merged.

Thank you very much for the script Spiritovod did, and I'm happy to report that as of today (Anniversary Edition, Free Version) I can still use this script to get game assets (I have successfully obtained meshes and textures). But when I import all the .fbx files under the "Animator" folder, open it and only consist of some empty objects, why?

I found the way around the memory limitation and the hairs:

All I did was to manually activate the page file in Windows and set the lower and upper limit to something ludicrous like 256GB, then I used AS to load the whole NarakaBladepoint_Data folder, it took between 15-20 mins to load everything and the final memory usage was an impressive 148GB (4GB Windows system, 24GB RAM and 120GB of virtual memory (page file)), so unless you have a PC with around 128GB+ of RAM you can use this method to load the whole game, AS will map/link all the files and expose stuff that doesn't show up when you load individual files, I'm still investigating if this includes the files that have no Unity header.

The funny thing is that I had Windows 10 using the dynamic page file allocation thinking it would automatically use/increase the page file on it's own but it didn't and it was causing the PC to crash/freeze, so . . . yeah, screw you Micro$oft!

This method can be used to accomplish the same for the MiHoyo games and the custom version of AS that exclusively loads/decrypts the assets of those games (HI3, GI, SR, ZZZ, ToT, etc.)

Cheers

For those curious - Unfortunately this method didn't work for me, as I am still get hit with out of memory errors. I manually updated the min/max of my windows page file to 256 GBs, then loaded the whole _Data folder using AS 15 since it tends to run better for loading this game's assets. I'm unsure if there is a step somewhere that I'm missing!

this workaround still works for me but the naraka files keep growing and growing, I have my OS in fast SSDs so I'm not sure if that contributes to not getting an out of memory error, anyways, recently I found an updated version of the asset studio by some guy called Razmoth that handle specific games like Naraka and Genshin Impact:

Yeah I also have everything on an SSD as well! So I'm not sure why the workaround isn't working for me.    I will give this AS version a shot and see if it works for grabbing hairs! Thank you so much!

In looking into this further - I can run the GUI version through Visual Studio but actually viewing/exporting anything doesn't seem to be working. I've followed the instructions to "1. Build CABMap (Misc. -> Build CABMap). then 2. Load files." but no matter what I'm selecting it's throwing an error (file not supported) after I've built the Map and tried loading files/folders. Any tips would be appreciated!

You need to use it with an unmodified version of the files.

Thank you for the tip! Even after trying it again using the unmodified version of the files I am still getting the same errors, so I am unsure what I may be doing wrong.

I ran the script and get the error information, does that mean the file has already incompatible with the script?

- open input file C:\quickbms\7d94d92897d908a5
- open script naraka_convert.bms

- error in src\quickbms.c line 1513: quickbms_main()
Error: No such file or directory
  coverage file 0     0%   0          435430740  . offset 00000000


Were you able to find out what caused the error? I'm running into the same problem

same problem, anyone know how to fix?

@Moonstrewn: CABMap is a feature for different game. Just select required game via Options -> Specify Game menu.

@nigetaro: It's better to use batch converting, because under certain circumstances quickbms may consider file without extension (asset bundle in this case) as path to a folder and it will fail. Example of batch conversion: [quickbms.exe -w script.bms "input folder with bundles"]

That might be the issue then! Naraka isn't listed in any way on the specify game menu! I figured it could be used since it was recommended to try in order to grab hair meshes! Thank you!

It should be possible to find the animator corresponding to the animationclip and export it together. But this game has too many files and I can't wait for assetstudio to load all the files, which may cause my computer to crash. Moreover, the naming of animation files is complicated. Animationclip and animator are placed in different files, making it difficult to correspond to them.
