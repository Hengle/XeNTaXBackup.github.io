- Post Title: Disney's Party voice files (GameCube) .DAT/.rel files

Hello, I'm trying to extract voices from Disney's Party,
I've found nothing on how to do it not even how to extract the game files, I also tried many tools and script that could help in extracting the game files or just extract sound from them but nothing worked, 

There're mainly .DAT files but also some .rel and .dat, there're also alway 5 files with the same name and same size except for one letter which looks like an indicator for the language (F = French, G = German, I = Italian, S = Spanish) but it's kind of weird that ALL files have a different language version.

So if anyone could help me in extracting the voices from this game here's a link with all the game files (simply extracted with Dolphin) because they also have a weird naming making it impossible to know which one could countain voices, thanks.
