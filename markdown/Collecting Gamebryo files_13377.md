- Post Title: Collecting Gamebryo files

I'm looking for nif files from various versions of the gamebryo engine.
If anyone has any games with .nif files, send them to me.

The files start with this:

```

```


NetImmerse File Format are fine too. I think they are older before they renamed it.

Just curious, what's your intended use?

Despite the support in Noesis, I never bothered compiling a list of games. I've just got random loose files scattered all over from various games, I don't even know where some of them came from.

Game compilation  
I just updated noesis and realized there's a plugin for it.

I've found a couple 20.6.5.0 and 20.6.0.1 models that aren't supported.
