- Post Title: PTExplorer for Smackdown vs Raw 2011?

Someone I know got the game early and said the file was the same name and everything as last year. That it just didn't open up with the PTExplorer so I was wondering if anyone here planned on updating it to work with 2011? 

Thanks for reading!

I'd like to see this updated for 2011 as well.

Yes, I see the original thread but I don't see anything about 2011. I was asking if PTExplorer will be updateded to work with SVR 2011.

The program needs to be updated so it can be used on the newest game(2011).
