- Post Title: True Crime DATA.PAK archive Need help extracting contents

I dunno where else i can put this, im hoping it grabs some attention because ive been scratching my head with this, it the DATA.PAK file from the PS2 games true crime streets of LA and True Crime New York City, I have the multiex commander proggie but it doesnt support my game archive i think i need an update for the multiex commander prog, the problem is, that its the unregisted version and i have no ways of buying the full version (which i think thats how you get updates) Mr. Mouse I dunno if you had any luck with my DATA.PAK Archive or not, or if you sent me any messages as I was away from a computer for a few weeks, man did that suck. so is there a way i can get support for my file? i either need an update or a new version pf multiex commander or some other working program for true crime DATA.PAK files thanks I appreciate your help Mr. Mouse   

P.S. i will upload the entire file for you on a hosting site if i can find one that allows uploading of big files, got any suggestions? im gonna look around for one, BTW is there a way to get you my email address without posting it in the forums like in a private message? thanks again.

Make a plugin request on the alucard.cc forums, the administrator (gnie) will make it for you!

Do you have a link to that forum or is it just alucard.cc?

Mr Mouse I can upload the entire DATA.PAK file on x7 files if you want, if it will help you, if you have a copy of the game true crime new york city its on there too, as for the hosting site this file might take forever to upload for me i dunno about their bandwidth or your connection . i dont really know how to use the file cutter unless you've figured out this file and have made a plugin already where can i download this plugin
