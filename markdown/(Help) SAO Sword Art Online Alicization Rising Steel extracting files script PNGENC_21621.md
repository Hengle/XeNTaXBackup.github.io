- Post Title: (Help) SAO Sword Art Online Alicization Rising Steel extracting files script PNGENC?

I have never ran across a file name PNGENC does anyone have any experience with this type of extension. When I open the files in HXD to follow guides for making a scripts for quickbms I can't seem to figure it out.

Added a rar of the pngenc file from the asset of [https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta ... s&hl=en_US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bandainamcoent.saoars&hl=en_US)

Any help be greatly appreciated
