If you mean RIFT the game ( [http://www.trionworlds.com/rift/en/](http://www.trionworlds.com/rift/en/) ), and it's assets?

If so, then you can use QuickBMS like outlined here: [https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=10119](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=10119)

Or if you prefer a a Java GUI you can use one of the programs here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/ ... _textures/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rift/comments/4gzw4g/extracting_game_model_files_and_textures/)

Or if you prefer python: [https://github.com/clowd81/rift_datamine_tools](https://github.com/clowd81/rift_datamine_tools)
