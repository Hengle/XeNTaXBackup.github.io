- Post Title: Need help with bf files from "Return to Mysterious Island"

I'm trying to extract the OGG music files from the adventure game "Return to Mysterious Island." HyperRipper finds some OGGs, but clearly not all of them. Jaeder Naub also finds some OGGs, but most do not play properly. I recently became a registered "Friend of MultiEx," but that can't read the archive format at all (I get a "Subscript out of range" error).

"Return to Mysterious Island" stores its resources in archives with the ".bf" extension. There are two CD folders, each containing several bf files of varying sizes. My presumption is that the music files are in the big ones (which are several hundred MB apiece). I have attached one of the tinier ones to this post -- a mere 36 bytes -- inside a ZIP file, in the hopes that this will be sufficient to "crack" the format. (I'm not hugely literate in these matters, so please let me know if I'm mistaken -- I'd be happy to upload the exact files in question, or at least some larger ones.)

In conclusion: I would love to see "Return to Mysterious Island" bf archives supported by MultiEx, or some other tool.

I am a new member here, so I apologize in advance if this is not the correct place to post this (or if it's not posted in the correct way). But this is music I have wanted for ages, and I'm hopeful that this is the place to come for help!

Please upload a file with at least one OGG in it.

I've written an extractor in C# (so, .NET is required).  I tested it with all the files in the demo, hopefully it will work for the complete game.  Source is included as well if any modifications are needed.  I've also included a .bat file to loop over *.bf, executing the tool.
