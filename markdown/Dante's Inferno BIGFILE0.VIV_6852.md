- Post Title: Dante's Inferno BIGFILE0.VIV

Is anyone interested in building up a file list for the BIGFILE0.VIV bank archive of dante's inferno with ricks Visceral games source tools?

[http://svn.slurm.us/public/visceral/trunk/](http://svn.slurm.us/public/visceral/trunk/)

I am not sure if rick is going to continue work in dante's inferno but if anyone is up for the challenge id would be interested as well.
