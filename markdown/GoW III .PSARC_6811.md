- Post Title: GoW III .PSARC

Hi everyone. I've been trying to translate God of War III to my language but there is a problem. PSARC Extractor doesn't work for this game. I extracted the RES.PSARC(which includes the text files), put in the game directory as a folder named "RES", started the game and it returned to XMB. 

Later, i found a compressor in this topic.(thx to Tosyk) Tried it. I saw the SM Studio intro.    But same, after it I returned to XMB.    Here is a small PSARC file(CHALLENGE.PSARC) from game and tools I used.

I extracted with "Extractor" and tried to compress with "Compressor"

Unfortunately caws friend tried to create this tool for me, just appreciates that the file has a type of hash, or something, why not open the game with modification.

I do not remember if I tried hex editing via prara see if it works, if it works maybe someone there can help.

hug
