looks like they encrypted the offset table most likely a xor or something.
you would need to post an exe of the game for someone to reverse the key out of it.
you can use offzip to get the files without names.

Some of the files are not compressed, though offzip should be able to handle them fine. But maybe not lol

Would in theory the re-import feature work? I know it's illegal to mod files for online games, but say if I wanted to change a music file to another, would it work?
