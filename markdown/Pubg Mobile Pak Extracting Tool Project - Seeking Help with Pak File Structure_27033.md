- Post Title: Pubg Mobile Pak Extracting Tool Project - Seeking Help with Pak File Structure

Hey everyone!

I'm currently working on a project to create a pubg mobile pak unpacking tool in C++. However, I've run into a roadblock as I'm unable to find the valid index offset and index size in the pak file. I understand that the pak file is encrypted, and the pak header contains information about the file, such as magic, version, index offset, and index size.

I would greatly appreciate any assistance or insights from those who are familiar with the pak file structure or have experience with similar projects. If you could share your knowledge or point me in the right direction, I'll be extremely grateful!

Thank you in advance for your help and support!
