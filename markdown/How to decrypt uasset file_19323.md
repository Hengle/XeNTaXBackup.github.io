- Post Title: How to decrypt uasset file?

hello guys,Iam trying to rip model and stuff from this game called Ascendant one using Umodel.
Too bad the file is encrypted and I cant crack it   
Here is the file in question: [https://mega.nz/#!TEpnTCCA!zgi2ScHLcr7O ... OQejWlun1o](https://mega.nz/#!TEpnTCCA!zgi2ScHLcr7OParmkBPMBRVuERYRAEPyzOQejWlun1o) please take a look if you will
Edit: I managed to extract the textures file using UE 4.16 script

Try using umodel by Gildor.
Provided the extraction process doesn't corrupt the files, you should be able to use umodel without issue.
