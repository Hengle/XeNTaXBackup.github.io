- Post Title: .XTEX??

Noesis wasn't showing any textures for me in the view port, because my textures were not in xtex format. I read the topic for DK Online and I don't see how people got .xtex texture format. I see how they got the .xac, but how did they get .xtex?

I only see these .pak files that represent textures:

Model_Data_dds_A.pak
Model_Data_dds_B.pak
Model_Data_dds_C.pak
Model_Data_dds_D.pak

Is there a .dds to xtex converter for DK Online?

I don't have the game but presumably you're supposed to unpack it.

Thnx for reply.
I re-installed the game and I extracted the .dds pak files. I got .dds texture files out of the pak. Sadly no xtex files. Idk what's wrong.

I used the tool recommended by Rimbros. It's fat duck's import tool. I only had to unpack the files using chroxx script. The dds worked fine. I didn't need the xtex after all. ^^
