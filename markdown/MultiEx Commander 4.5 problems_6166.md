I fixed the problem by uninstalling the software and completely removed every trace of the software in the registry and then reinstalled it to the c:\ location. I've also set it to run as administrator and to have winxp compatibility.

Thank you for the bug report. This is a problem in 4.5? You tried to update from within MultiEx Commander ?

You tried to update from within MultiEx Commander ?No probs, yeah I did try updating within MultiEx Commander but I was still getting the same errors. It did download the plugins but when it ask to restart the program that's when it showed those errors. The above is what fixed the problem, I do know that Windows 7 is very picky with folder & file permission in the Programs Folders, so that's probably what the issue is here.
