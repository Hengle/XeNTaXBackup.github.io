- Post Title: Dragon's Dogma fonts

Hi! I'm translating DD:DA into my native language and I would welcome any tips in how to change in-game fonts. 
I need to be able to use letters like 'śćńźżąęół'.
Thanks in advance.

Especially try arctool with -tex option.

You can PM me if you want.

Edit text: arc tool or gmd editor
Edit texture: use ARC TOOL or hex editor to convert a dds file (dont change file size) & (dont chang type of dds: dxt1, dxt3, dxt5)
Edit font file (gfd): we dont have any tool for .gfd file... Try on hex editor
Edit scripts: use hex editor
I hope this things can help you
Good luck

Thanks for answering! 
This file I've sent before was just a texture, converting it to .dds did the trick. But editing textures is not my concern for now.
I somehow didn't realize that fonts are in .gfd format. 
Now I used ARC tool to convert files with *.2D462600 extension to .gfd... aaand I don't have any clue how to open them. 
I tried with hex editor tho, but it shows me some nonsense crap, symbols, numbers etc. Definitely not what I'm looking for.
I'll upload one of those files here.

P.S. I'm sorry if I miss something obvious. I'm just new at that kind of stuff.
