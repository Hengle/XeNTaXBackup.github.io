I've just heard while searching google about a program that can rip models from video files. Here is the official site:

[http://www.acvt.com.au/research/videotrace/](http://www.acvt.com.au/research/videotrace/)

It is currently in development, but will be released in the near future. It is probably the envy of most any 3d Modeler.

That kind of technology produces incredibly dense and uneven meshes, they look nice as static objects, but the actual grid mesh is a modeller's nightmare.

Sometimes it's less work to hand made a 3D model from scratch, that to try to clean one of those meshes.

Looks like a video based version of a modeler a few years back called Canoma.  You used a few reference shots of buildings or a computer or something, then you did a similar process to make the actual polygons. Was ... ok for what it did, but nothing to write home about. As all projection mapping based  modelers have one inherent problem.  they only look REALLY good from the angle they are modeled at. Once you start moving around the back of them then the textures suddenly start looking a bit warped.

If you want to model a real world building for google earth, then this is the modeler for you!!! If on the other hand you actually like models to be correct, then i wouldn't touch it with a 10ft pole ( altho you could probably model the pole with this app    )

I think this program will be incredibly powerful when it can incorporate Learning, that is it can know that buildings are symmetrically, living things should not have highly pointed edges,  and even more subtle things like power laws: that large objects like walls have a similar amount of detail as small objects only to scale, meaning that a 1 foot by 1 foot section of a wall will probably not have as many faces as 1 by 1 section of lamp which in turn does not have as much detail as the same size of the inside wiring of a TV.
