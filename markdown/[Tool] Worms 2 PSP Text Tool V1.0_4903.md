- Post Title: [Tool] Worms 2 PSP Text Tool V1.0

Well, i was here doing nothin then i decide to code...

I ended up finding this game and i've created this tool for whoever wants to translate the texts (they're inside the .zip file within the iso).

So, whoever likes this kind of game (i don't) this tool is for ya.

It extracts the texts from the .bin files to a txt and can recreate the bin from the txt file.

Proof that it works:
