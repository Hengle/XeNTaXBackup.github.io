Can you help me to see if this file is damaged, the sound inside can not be played, if not how do I extract it?

I've tried to extract sounds using these tools [https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=131393#p131393](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=131393#p131393)
but with no luck.   

It may be some custom fsb format.

I tried this tool. The file should be encrypted.
