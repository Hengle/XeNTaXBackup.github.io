- Post Title: C.S.I. New York dat Extractor - Ready for you

Studying the zlib implementation in c, i wrote this tiny program that allow to extract everything from .dat files in C.S.I. New York.

Here you are. If you want some explanation, just ask, I have no time for it right now.

I included the zlib1.dll file, but it should'nt be necessary beacuse it's already present inside the game dir

Could anybody else continue the project?
I would really need the repacker.

Vash can't make the repacker (he wrote)...
