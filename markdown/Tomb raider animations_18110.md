dunno, at least you'll get a mesh with skeleton here using Gh0stBlade's fmt_TR2_mesh_1_5.py script with Noesis:

(Including support for bones and weights, iirc.)

Nothing have been ripped, if you talk about the TR2 remake, everything was done from "scratch" with 3ds max mainly.
The lara model is based on a modified underworld version, but the animations are made with video references of underworld anniversary and legend.

Sadly nobody has made an importer for Tomb Raider animations yet.
