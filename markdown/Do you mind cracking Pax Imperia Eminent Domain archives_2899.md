Do you mind cracking Pax Imperia Eminent Domain archives (*.img)? Included is a RAR archive containing a sample file (Infra.img) and a file from another part of the Pax Imperia Eminent Domain installation which may be of use reading it (PalData). If PalData is also an archive please attempt cracking it as well.
