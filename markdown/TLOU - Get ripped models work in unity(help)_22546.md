- Post Title: TLOU - Get ripped models work in unity(help)

I'm trying to make a complete 3d Joel model from TLOU work in unity.
I used the tools to extract model and animation from here [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=15816](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=15816).
The problem is that the extracted model from the game is in separate files: 

I tried to connect in blender manually but i failed(the problem is that it don't work correctly with animations).
Is someone able to do it?
This is the files: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/tyu07vxrt ... l.zip/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/tyu07vxrthtw07w/Joel.zip/file)
