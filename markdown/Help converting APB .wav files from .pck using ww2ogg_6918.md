- Post Title: Help converting APB .wav files from .pck using ww2ogg

So i've been trying to get ahold of the audio in APB for a few weeks, and haven't had a lot of luck.
Struggled for a while trying to extract the sound from the game's .pck, finally managed to do so today.
Got ahold of 935 .wav files.
Problem is, they are unplayable.
From what i've read by searching around, I need to use ww2ogg to convert them. My problems here are A. I'm not too familiar with the program, and B. I don't even know if i'm doing everything right.
Everyone seems to say that ww2ogg takes .RIFF files as it's data input... but the only files contained in the .pck were .wav files, no .RIFFs :/

Am I missing something? Or doing something wrong?
Any help is highly appreciated...


NOTE: When I try to run the file through using a command prompt (since I can't open the .exe without it flashing on screen for a second before closing), I get an error.
Parse error: expected fmt, vorb, data chunks

No idea what this means, i'm assuming it's because i'm trying to input the .wav file?
