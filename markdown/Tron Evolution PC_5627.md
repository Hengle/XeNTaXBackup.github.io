I can't seem to get the models out of this game using umodel.  All I get is the anim sets and textures.  The game crashes when I try to use 3dripper dx.
Here's a .upk file [http://www.4shared.com/file/z8jydPnk/Qu ... al_SF.html](http://www.4shared.com/file/z8jydPnk/QuorraActual_SF.html)

try with the last version of umodel...bye  

EDIT: I don't understand if I extracted the model correctly, because the mesh is ok but textures seems really small 
        for a standard unreal engine 3 game.....  maybe this is a low polyg version of the character.....

The models are low poly for a newer game like this.  It was probably a rushed production.  I'll try with the new umodel thx.

Here's a little trick, you can copy the Textures.tfc file that's in the CookedPC folder and paste it in the same folder as the .upk file your extracting.
This will allow umodel you to rip higher resolution textures.

This video game is not at all good. Thank you nevertheless.

Would there be another way to extract the textures that isn't through 3dripper dx?
