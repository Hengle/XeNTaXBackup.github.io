- Post Title: Kingdom Hearts Re:Com Models

Yo, name's GovanifY.

I was wondering if someone already reversed re:com formats there 'cause I'm not that good on 3d stuff in general. W/e for me it looks like a common ps2 model but, b\c it's square enix, it's modified, I'll bet my hand on this. Also noesis cannot view those models(and he supports .mdl files)so I'm sure there's some mods on those files

Here's some samples I extracted from the game(custom extractor ftw)

This list is obviously not complete, I just tooked all files of an archive in re:com, and putted them into mega.

Hoping someone know how those models are actually working, GovanifY
