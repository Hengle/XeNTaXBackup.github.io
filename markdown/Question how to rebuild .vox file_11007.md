- Post Title: Question how to rebuild .vox file

(Dialogic) .VOX file is a bigfile/container of audio like .ogg .wav .mp3 etc..
More info :

```
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogic_ADPCM
```


The problem is can extract the .vox file with a tool from this forum (GOBREAD) but the tool dont let you rebuild the .vox file, i have installed almost every program sugested to handle or make .vox files without any kind of lucky or success.
Also i've tried with Adobe Audition CC but this tool can let open .vox files but dont let you save or export into this formal.

Any suggestion? Someone knows wich tool can i use to rebuild .vox files or maybe a script to can be used with quickbms to rebuild?

Thanks!!!

P.S: The vox files i want to rebuild contains mostly a .ogg and some .wav and also i see a one .dat file.

I think you are confused here. 
VOX you refer to as audio format only holds raw dialogic adpcm in mono and IT IS NOT an archive, the chance is
you have some specific game archive with that particular same extension and since you said it holds wav and ogg and thus it is actually archive then and has nothing to do with the vox audio format.

As for gobread, it is strictly unpacker tool and won't be of any use packing them back.
