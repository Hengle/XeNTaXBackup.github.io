- Post Title: How to Extract Sound Effects? HELP ME OUT

I saw that is possible to extract sound effects from games and I was wondering how you guys do it, I'd like to extract sounds from some games too, but I can't figure out how. I actually managed it but the quality of the files is very low, and they are in Mp3. I want Wav files instead, for a better quality. I've recently got the game "Watch Dogs 2" but as I said, I can't figure out how to extract sounds files (wav format not mp3). I saw and read tons of tutorials but nothing helped me. I left a sample at the following link, where there should be the sounds inside, since is over 2gb and there's written "sound". But please guys, don't say me to encode, modify extension, cnvert or something about that because I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO IT ALONE, I need someone to talk to. By the way, this won't be the last time I ask,so I was also wondering if someone is willing to help me through a conversation by facebook or Vk, leave your profile and I will add you. It's really really really important. Thanks in advance
