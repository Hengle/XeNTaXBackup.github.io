- Post Title: [PSP] God Eater 2 .GMO

Hello~ I managed to extract the .rdp for God Eater 2 and came out with some GMOs and GIMs but when I try to load them in Noesis, it doesn't work. I have a pretty recent version, if not the newest one. I haven't really checked. I was wondering if anyone here could possibly have a look at these and see if its possible to make a script for them. I think for PSP models, they look quite pretty. 
Heres a sample if you can help me:

I don't know if the GMOs in the Sample are actually models or animations though. When it comes to binary and stuff I'm pretty stupid. I have near no knowledge of this stuff so yeah. Sorry.

Your extractor is quite thoroughly fucked apparently, as one of those "GIM" files is clearly raw ADPCM data, and on the whole everything you uploaded is garbage.
