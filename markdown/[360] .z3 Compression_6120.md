- Post Title: [360] .z3 Compression

Well, I was wondering if anyone can give me some advice on how to maybe decompress this file. Its a file found in Black Ops for the Zork mini game. And i would really like to see what's inside. 

I'm not very good at all with compression methods so i was hoping you guys could help? 

I did do some initial searching on google and came up with nothing, then i came over here and tried to do a search but the I couldn't optimize a search for .z3

Any help is GREATLY appreciated.
