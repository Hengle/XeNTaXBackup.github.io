- Post Title: Mad Max - Unpacking and Packing

There's probably no one interested in the game anymore, but i'm starting that thread anyways.

I've wrote an Unpakke module that support both packing and unpacking for the .TAB and the SARC files (BL, CL, EE, FL and NL)

There's one pitfall, tho:

Some of the original archives (.TAB) has header section that I wasn't able to completely reverse engineer. Repacking these files will crash your game.
However, you can still build your own patches or DLC's so, that's at least something...

As most of you probably already know, the game uses checksum based file naming.
I was able to fish out ~45000 out of ~50000 file names with their complete file pathes, so you can *theoretically* unpack the whole game and play it without using the .TAB/.ARC files (didn't test it completely).

Lastly, i didn't checked if anyone in here already built such tool, so if this thread repeats another one, you can just delete it.

Overall, that's all.

You can find Unpakke and the Mad Max module here: [http://www.nullsecurity.org/unpakke](http://www.nullsecurity.org/unpakke)
Just make sure you read the readmies provided before asking questions.

And now, here's some stupid screenshots.

Is it possible to translate this game with your unpakke module?

It's possible to unpack and pack back the files. Still, you will have to figure out the texts format by yourself.

Move the content of game0 directly to the "Mad Max" folder.

Can you fix this repacking thing if you try?

It still doesn't work correctly, i didn't figure it out 

Can you make a briefing and write your way to do that like step 1, step 2, step 3 ?

Sorry to sound stupid if I do, but I'm sort of getting my head around all this... I've managed to unpack the .tab/.arc files and have been given .bins. What should I be doing to open up these? Really keen to get my hands on the models and have a look through what's in there!

Hello XpoZed and thanks for this great tool. I'm trying to unpack the Mad Max files and Unpakke creates proper folder and file structure, however if I open any of the files in notepad++, all files are full of "NULLs". Am I doing something wrong? I put the Mad Max module (avalanche.umod and other files) inside the modules folder, updated the ini file, and also put ZLIB1.DLL inside libs folder.

Indeed. What is the point of all this? In the end bin files either you have the proper decoding, or they're pretty useless.
