I was curious as to why there was no posting of the new version on the forums, considering I got the email about it a few days ago. I was almost going to start a new thread for it, but now it seems I don't need to worry.

Looking good though - I installed it today and will have to experiment around alittle with the new scripting tools and stuff - lots of fun 

Thanks for the nice comments on the About-type screens too!!
