- Post Title: Sunset Overdrive 3D models

Hi, I´ve recently been playing sunset overdrive, and liked the 3D models of the weapons. So I decided to figure out if it was possible to extract them from the game. The problem is that the files from the game don´t have any extension so if someone could help I would appreciate it.

Thanks.

That is how the files look like.

Might be worth uploading a file or two as a sample to be examined.
