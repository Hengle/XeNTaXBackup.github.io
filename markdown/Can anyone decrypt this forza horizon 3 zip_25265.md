I tried to play those samples with foobar2000 + vgmstream plugin, with Winamp,with Media Player Classic and with Audacity.
In all of those cases, the music was silent, no correct audio was detected.  

Something is wrong with those samples from the first post. It may be extraction issue etc.

I'm almost certain I got some sounds when I tried before, but I've redownloaded them and while they do play, they're silent because the audio data is basically blank.  Not sure what happened there...

Damn. Maybe Forza left this empty on purpose as a placeholder and there really isn't audio in these zips? Or maybe its heavy heavy encryption.
