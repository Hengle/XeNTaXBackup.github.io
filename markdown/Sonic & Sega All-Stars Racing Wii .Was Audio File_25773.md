[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AvNj72HA0RvsSyrqL2E0mqeTRSk_FMVF?usp=sharing) it seems like a .Dsp file from nintendo [https://gbatemp.net/threads/dspadpcm-ds ... sy.390305/](https://gbatemp.net/threads/dspadpcm-dsp-audio-encoding-made-easy.390305/) , if i delete the two beginning offsets then this is a vailid .dsp file but it's still glitchy.

It will play directly in Foobar/vgmstream as it is.  It's not a standard DSP file, but a stereo variation.

This is what I noticed too, 

 A stereo dsp file is created twice, once for the left and once for the right. Although the left and right are both already inside the file
