For those that care, I had this exe for a while... it just automates gildor's umodel.

Place ripper.exe, umodel.exe, and SDL.dll in same directory, in the root directory where all XXX and UPK files are (in the same directory or any subdirectory where ripper.exe is) and ripper.exe will seek them out and run umodel.exe -export -all "filename" on them.
