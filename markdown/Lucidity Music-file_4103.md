Try this one. I was able to get Lucidity's music with it. Also the music from PURE and BioShock and so on.
Don't know where I got it though.

I remembered where I got it.
Here: [http://www.ctpax-x.ru/index.php?goto=files&show=24](http://www.ctpax-x.ru/index.php?goto=files&show=24)
I don't understand Russian, but downloading the program is not hard. 

Pure for example isn't in the supported games list, but it works without any problems.
Just try the program on files with a similar extension and see if it works.

Now that I managed to extract the msuic from another game in xwb format with correct filenames, I tried to get Lucidity's music with unxwb and correct filenames.
After extracting the music, the filenames are mixed up for Lucidity and don't have the correct names. Anything that can be done here? For example the track bysanlull is called cornfield1 and so on.
