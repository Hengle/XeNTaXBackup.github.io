I can't seem to decode the audio files here, i believe its packed XMA but running it trhough ea multi xma didn't spit out anything, also ran it through xma test seeing as it looks multichannel didn't do anything either, it looks 100% xma but then again it could be packed or some ea variant i can't make out.

EDIT: nvm figured it out  was doing the wrong offset in eamultixma

I have thought if in ea_ multi_xma i dont use any -o option, it will use -o 0x0, but it seems i was wrong!
thanks for helping, but it didnt work. ea_ multi_xma says: "doesn't look like an EA multi XMA stream"
P.S: i had sent you a pm about how you extract and decode music/sound of medal of honor 2010. can you also help me in this game?
