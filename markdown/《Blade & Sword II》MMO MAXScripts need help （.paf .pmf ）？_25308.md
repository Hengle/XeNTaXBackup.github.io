- Post Title: 《Blade & Sword II》MMO MAXScripts need help （.paf .pmf ）？

This is a very Oriental Fantasy martial arts game
Costumes in the game is very special
The movement of the model is very typical of Chinese Kungfu.
Very strong sense of attack
I use BMS to unpack these resources (quickbms0.7.5 version)
[http://aluigi.org/bms/blade_sword_2.bms](http://aluigi.org/bms/blade_sword_2.bms)
But don't know how the model and the action of these files open
Hope to be able to get help
