- Post Title: NFSW Language .bin Editor

Is there a editor or a tool that can open the .bin laguage file from Need for Speed World?

There are tools for NFS Carbon / Most Wanted created by nfsu360 but with them i cannot open the .bin language file from Need for Speed World because the file encryption is other than the older games.

I write here because i think that the users here can help me but i don't know if someone will help me because the game is Online only and no one will lose his time to create a tool about this filetype and for the game i think.

I can write to nfsu360 a mail but i don't know if he have e-mail.   

Aargh, i forgotten to say - Happy new year to everyone!

So, i send him a mail before 3 days but he don't answer me. Maybe he is busy with something or he don't check his mail but i think that he is not using this mail. Maybe i'm wrong but i don't know.

two *bumps*

I send a mail to nfsu360 on the mail that merlinsvk gived to me but there's no answer from him about two months from January 07 and maybe he don't use this mail anymore.

Is there a chance to contact him or...?  

I checked his site at bl*gspot but it's not updated from January...

1 month has passed and no information for/about nfsu360....   

I don't know what's going on with that guy, but maybe he will not update and make new tools for Need for Speed games anymore (i think).

So, if i'm not cheeky, is there "anyone" who can do something about the .bin files or i'm just writing to myself in that thread?

NfS World's language .bin file(s) are the same as the older games (UG2, MW, Carbon), but it's little modified and that's why nfsu360's LangEd tool isn't opening it right. The tool needs to be updated to support World but i see that nfsu360 isn't updated his site for about three months and i can't contact him thru' e-mail.
