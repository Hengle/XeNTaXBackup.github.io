- Post Title: Jurassic World Evolution Extract animations and Sounds(Help)

I played here in this beautiful game. After seeing beautiful models and animations of dinosaurs in it, I decided to make mods for the game ARK Survival Evolved, but there is one problem. Need animation and sounds. This program does not work for them, I learned that it is easy to get all the files using ZLIB, but after loading Zlib, I realized that I don’t understand anything, it’s not like a program, a simple set of files. So, if someone understands this ZLIB, please help! Since I really want to supplement the ARK game with new animations and new dinosaurs, I think that those who played ARK know that the graphics are beautiful there, but there are few popular dinosaurs and a lot of clumsy and very primitive animation, and the sounds seem like the developers were sitting there and yelled into the microphone to make a miserable semblance of dinosaur voices. That's why I decided to take on such a global modification. So I need your help.
