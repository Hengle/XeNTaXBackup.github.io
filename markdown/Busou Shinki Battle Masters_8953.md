- Post Title: Busou Shinki Battle Masters

Hi, I manage to unpack the Busou Shinki games for PSP, both of them comes in .CPK files that you can unpack with Noesis, there you can find .gim files for images, there are also some .gmo files for backgrounds and scenes, but I can't find the Character models, there's a type of file with .bnd extention, I don't know anything about programing, can't tell if are models or packed files, I don't upload some examples beacuse the new rules, I hope anyone can help.
