- Post Title: File corrupted

I have files with a special encryption and i cant' decrypt it.

example: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/9h4hp ... _corrupted](http://www.mediafire.com/download/9h4hpdh433git9d/File_corrupted)

how can i decrypt it?

I think it is compressed with ZLIB
[File corrupted.zip](https://xentaxbackup.github.io/file/6432_File corrupted.zip)
