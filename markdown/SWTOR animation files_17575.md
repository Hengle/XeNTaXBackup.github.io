- Post Title: SWTOR animation files?

Hello! I was wondering if it was possible to somehow utilize the JBA files that are in swtor? As far as I have tried I cannot for the life of me find anything out about them or figure out how to use them. Does anyone have any information on this?

The only thing I found out about it is that jedipedia had figured it out but nothing else sadly.
