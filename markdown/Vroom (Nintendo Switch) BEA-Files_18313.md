- Post Title: Vroom (Nintendo Switch) BEA-Files

Hey guys,

I've extracted the RomFS of the Game "Vroom - Nintendo Switch" today.
It's not a very special game but it's somehow a Meme already (Superman 64 2).

I just want to extract the BEA Files (Bezel Engine Archive) to check the files.
I would love to repack this files, too!
The format seems to be pretty simple but... I'm too dumb to create my own scripts for something like this ^^'

I've uploaded some files in a Zip-Archive.

Hopefully you can help me out with that!
