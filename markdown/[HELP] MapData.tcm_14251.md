- Post Title: [HELP] MapData.tcm

Hi, good day to you all!

I was wondering if someone can help me on how to open this kind of file?

I think this where the logical layout of the map, what I want to achieve is open this and

import to 3dsmax to edit the layout of the map and pack it back again.

I dont know what to do, I've been googling how to open .tcm but I didnt get any good result about it.

Here is the file,

Thank you!

P.S.
Sorry if my english is poor not my native tongue.
