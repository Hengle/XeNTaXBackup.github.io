Here is the sample .xsf file I extracted from .big file of Skate 3, with the help of Aluigi's bms script.

- Post Title: Skate 3 Texture file .xfs

There are lots of nice textures in Skate 3.

I have extracted ".xsf" from their ".big" archive file with the help of Aluigi's bms script "skate3.bms".

But after getting .xsf file, I didn't find any way to convert these .xsf file to any readable texture format.

So can anybody please help on this.
