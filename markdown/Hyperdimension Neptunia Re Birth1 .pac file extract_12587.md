Well guys, I bought Hyperdimension Neptunia Re Birth1 on Steam, and wanted to help me extract the files that are in .pac format. I was looking for Hex Editor, and appeared "DW_PACK" in the file first, do not know if that helps. I want to extract the file because I intend to translate the game to the Pt-br. I would appreciate any help !!!

NOTE: I have the translation of the game in Chinese. I uploaded it because the Chinese translation might have some in the executable script that extract the .pac file and enter the translation in. I could not extract the .exe translation, but anyone can try, as this translation translates the game to the Chinese, it can apredentar tracks. If only they can extract the translation and see their scripts, so would be easier. I hope you understand what I said above !!!

Chinese translation of the game !!! [https://mega.co.nz/#!npEV3IKZ!j1zQkQv_y ... umFv7HHqzA](https://mega.co.nz/#!npEV3IKZ!j1zQkQv_yUMUuskLLNz6lWyAzKRn9bxjTumFv7HHqzA)
