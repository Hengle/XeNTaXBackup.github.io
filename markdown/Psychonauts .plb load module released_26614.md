- Post Title: Psychonauts .plb load module released

I have finished my Psychonauts .plb load module.

I have released the following program:
- 3D Object Converter v10.004 (Windows)

How to get the 3D Object Converter v10.004:
Download the 3D Object Converter from [ http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version (if you donâ€™t have it yet).
(Or just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the v10.004.)
