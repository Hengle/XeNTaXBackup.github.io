Hey guys -- there doesn't seem to have been much movement on these in the past so I'm hoping, given how great a lot of the models are in this game, someone might be able to help me bust these open and get some of them out there. I've managed to unpack the basic "rpack" archives the game employs, but after running Luigi's quickbms to open those, I'm given .dat files of various (and usually large) sizes. I've had a look at the data using HexEdit (which I'm still not much good with beyond seeing what's inside something), and can see that there are meshes and material data in the archives, I'm just not entirely sure how to unpack these. Here's one example: [https://mega.nz/#!KIpWwBga!x0EtsupNOtzR ... -11xfca4WU](https://mega.nz/#!KIpWwBga!x0EtsupNOtzRxY0msazerPGejfkkUJCJ2-11xfca4WU)

Also contained withing the rpack I extracted was this .ico and .vap file. The .vap file seems to have something to do with the materials...
