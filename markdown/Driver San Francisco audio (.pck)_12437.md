- Post Title: Driver: San Francisco audio (.pck)

Hello!
I was trying to extract audio from Driver: San Francisco using program simply named 'Extractor'. I got over 500 .wav files which are playable in VLC but plays nothing but some random white noise. I presume that WWiseDefault.pck is the file that contains audio files.

Use [Wwise IMA ADPCM Tool](https://bitbucket.org/zabb65/payday-2-modding-information/downloads/sound_conveter_v1.15.zip) for music, and [ww2ogg](http://www.hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html) for sound effects.
