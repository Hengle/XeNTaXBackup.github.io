Is there any tools that can view (and maybe extract) skeleton data similar to Hex2obj? There is files from a game that have skeleton data separated from their mesh and i'd love to look at them. I saw people that have managed to do it but didn't explained how they did. It'l be great if there was tutorials too.

Well, I started the skel2SMD project 3.5 years ago, very ugly/not_user_friendly and never released.  
(Too many different formats/matrices for me...  )

But you might read here (a lot to read but it's worth it  ):
