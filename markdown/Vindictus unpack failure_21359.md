- Post Title: Vindictus unpack failure?

I managed to get the hfs files to be unpacked with a quickbms script, but now I've got a big bunch of .dat files - not a single .mdl file or something like that... The bms script was this one: [Vindictus bms script](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/mabinogi_heros_hfs.bms) This got me so many files, I absolutely have no idea where to search for the stuff needed - [here's](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lfG4vQ493lO5ovds-PoVU1uPlPKfh_DO) a sample folder. The files I need are some model and texture files for Sylas: I need the model and texture files for him in the High Elf Prince, Aerial Agility and the Casual Suit Sets as well as the Buffalo Plaid inner armor.

EDIT: I've added the original file to the unpacked one in the zipped file, if you want to try that script for yourself  The link has been updated accordingly.

Where did I make my mistake?
And where are the files to be found?
