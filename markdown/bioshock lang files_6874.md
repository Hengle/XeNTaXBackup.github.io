The english texts are in the .u files in Unicode format, but no way you can extract them. The only recommended translation way, if you install a non-english version, and you find the localisedesp, localiseddeu, etc .lbf file. This contain all - non-english- texts in one place.
The localisedint.lbf and an another file (I can't remember it's name) contain some english texts, but those are 5-10% of the full texts.

OK, then do you know a website, that has english transcipts extractad from the gameplay? And Is there a way to edit fonts?
One last, is there a way to extract texts from RAM with a program. I can find by searching, but they just only 0x8000 size , I guess total size is about 1500kB that means over 50 blocks text. And I can easily miss, short ones.

No other extracted text. You can't edit the font or other textures.

I made an .u unpacker, but no text extracter, the texts are all over the file in blocks. And most important, those are not Unreal3 .int format, thos are just texts.

thanks for your help, but you shared bioshock 2 files. And you said you made an .u unpacker. I need just need that texts which are not like in ini files(does not have such format: [labels] sometxt="somtxt" ). Just plain text blocks.

Please send me the file(s) which content do you need, and I'll extract for you, if I can.
I cannot refresh the link of the mentioned file, because I deleted it, it was 8 years old.
