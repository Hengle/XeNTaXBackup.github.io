- Post Title: Riddick: Dark Athena .xmd File (PC)

Hi, I wanted to replace the old (2004) assault rife model with the newer one (2009). When I replace it, the in-game model is OK but it needs some fixes. I have to extract the .xmd files to fix these problems.

This is a sample file of the Butcher Bay version of assault rifle (2009). If you need that old version of assault rifle (2004), just let me know.

Thanks
