- Post Title: Help Converting BDAE?

So I don't really know much about converting these kind of things and I don't plan on doing it frequently so I was wondering if someone could please help me to convert three models? Specifically Nick, Bogo, and Judy from the Disney Magic Kingdom mobile app. If you can convert them to obj/fbx/dae/whatever Blender is willing to play well with that'd mean a lot to me! Textures not necessary since I mainly want to check out their meshes but it would help me if you can get those too.

Thank you in advanced anyone willing to lend me a hand!
