Note that although I say "pure python", it uses PIL for image processing cause I don't have any libraries for that.
But that's only for the .xx format. If you just want MQO's just use the -f option 

```

This is something I made when I was first learning how to parse and convert 3D formats.
It is a pure python implementation with absolutely no regard for performance.
It's more like a programming exercise than anything.

It uses only the standard python libraries.
Being pure python has several perks though, such as being rather portable.

You can run it in command-line.
You could add a user interface for it.
You could toss this into blender with a blender export script it'll take it no problem. Maybe.
You could toss this into google app engine and make it a webapp.

The functionality is quite limited since I have little background, so it stores the bare minimum and provides no useful functions like noesis does.

It is more of an educational tool than anything.
I want to write a blender script at least lol
And add an interface that accepts noesis python plugins so I don't have to do the same work again.

I'm also planning to write a similar tool for converting image formats. Maybe I'll call it Sanae2D.
