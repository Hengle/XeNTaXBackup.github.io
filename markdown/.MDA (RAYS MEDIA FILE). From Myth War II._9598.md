- Post Title: .MDA (RAYS MEDIA FILE). From Myth War II.

*.MDA is a container.

Structure:
typedef struct header{
	char ID[16];// = "RAYS MEDIA FILE\0";
	int unkn1a[2];
	int filescount;// number of files in this container
	int unkn1b[3];
} header;
typedef struct filedescriptor{
	char filename[32];//with trash (?) after first '\n'
	int offset;//offset from beginning of file to IMG256
	int size;// size of IMG256
} filedescriptor;
typedef struct IMG256{
	char ID[16];//= "RAYS IMG256 FILE";
	int unkn2[4];
	int size_of_data;
	char palette[3*256];
	int offset_to_data;//offset from begin of this struct; always 0x328;
	char pixeldata[size_of_data];
} IMG256;

So, format of pixeldata in IMG256 is unknown, width and height are unknown too. Pixel data looked like packed (RLE?).

If anyone can help... welcome!

Hello!!
VERY LATE but hope you see it somehow...
Can you post an exe that does the opposite now? TGA into MDA (to edit image repack and use on the game itself)
