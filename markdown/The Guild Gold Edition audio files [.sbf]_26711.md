- Post Title: The Guild: Gold Edition audio files [.sbf]

I am trying to extract the voice lines/sound effects from the game, but I just cannot get the right settings in VGMToolbox's GENH creator to get it to sound as anything more than noise. I am using the settings from [viewtopic.php?p=52538](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=52538) because they were the only ones I could find for the [.sbf] filetype.

I uploaded the game's sfx folder here, if anybody wants to test things:
[https://mega.nz/folder/bTgVBZBZ#j7VRdGArl19Y8-D_SsS_lA](https://mega.nz/folder/bTgVBZBZ#j7VRdGArl19Y8-D_SsS_lA)

Would really appreciate any help.

I've only tried it on a couple of your samples, but here's a QuickBMS script to extract the .wav files, which play fine in Fooba/vgmstream (they're MS IMA audio).

Thanks a lot friend. It works perfectly on most of the files but for some reason an "incomplete input file" error appears on some of them. I managed to find what I was searching for though, so I am just saying that for anyone else that may be interested.
Here is the whole error message: [https://imgur.com/a/IfvsXAX](https://imgur.com/a/IfvsXAX)

Thank you again, have a good one!

I had a quick look at the one that didn't work and corrected my script.  Hopefully it should be fine on all archives now.

Tried it out and no errors appeared. Works perfectly!
