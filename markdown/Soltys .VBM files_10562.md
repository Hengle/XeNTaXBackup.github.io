- Post Title: Soltys .VBM files

Hello, I'm trying to find a way to edit the graphics of a game called Soltys. It's a Polish graphic adventure from 1995 that was recently released as a freeware game on ScummVM.

I want to translate a few of the graphics, but it seems they are compressed, and separated into four pieces. Anyone who wants to attempt this can check part of the ScummVM source code looking for the CGE engine.

And here's the files:

And here's the full game, for anyone who wants it:

Thanks in advance.
