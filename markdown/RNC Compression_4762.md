- Post Title: RNC Compression

I have an RNC file (well many all in the one file by the looks since it has many RNC headers in the one dat file) and I have downloaded the official RNC compression tool from it's developer, however there is not much info on the RNC file format. 

Here is a snippet of a very small part of the file:


As you can see, some of it is readable. I also read someone the RNC can use a key to compress/lock the file... how would I go about finding the key if it has one?

Any help is appreciated.
