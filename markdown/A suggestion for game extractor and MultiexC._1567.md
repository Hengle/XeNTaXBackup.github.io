- Post Title: A suggestion for game extractor and MultiexC.

This it's for a full versions, can be possible to add a option for a make "standalone" creator of any the format?

For example:

i have a game, and i can extract it and create his format, but i need a to have a full version of th eprograma, can be posssible to add the option of "create standalone" of this format? 

it's just an idea/suggestion.

Thanks 4 all ;-D

I'm not sure what you mean, you wish to have sort of a stand-alone packer that will replace/add new files to an already existing archive? Sort of as an automated patch-er?

I don't really know what you mean either  . Do you mean "can we make a small program that will read and write archives for a specific game only" - in contrast to our programs that work on a lot of different games.

If this is what you mean, then it is definately possible with both our programs. With MultiEx you would just need to have a program that reads the *.bms script for the game you want. With Game Extractor - it is a similar process - you just make a program to use the read and write methods of the plugin for the game. Someone did this recently for Dungeon Siege 2 using my code - I think he called it Tank Unpacker or something.

I am not sure just how easy it is for MultiEx to be cut back because there is a fair bit of code behind the script reading. For Game Extractor, if I were to make a cut-back program, I would probably be able to get it down under 100kb.

I don't know if I would actually do this though, because I would rather everyone know Game Extractor rather than know the little program that only works for 1 or 2 games.

I know its kinda annoying to have to install Java before you can use Game Extractor - MultiEx definately has an advantage there as it is standalone, however most people actually have Java installed already. Thankfully, both our programs are relatively small anyway considering the amount of work that they do - I don't think people can really complain about a few MB of downloading can they?
