- Post Title: How to find the Fonts in a .WAD Game?

Hi, I'm making a map of a large game territory and I would like to use the font the game uses because it looks good, I tried to find/match the game's font for a few days, but I've had no luck even though there are great tools to find fonts online.  

So, I was wondering where a game usually keeps the fronts they use, it's a older (2013-present) game and I've used XaNTaX's tools to extract the WADs, I got GBs of .PNGs from the extraction, but no fonts.

If you know how to find or extract fonts, or what font is used for Defiance maps, please let me know, thanks in advance!  =)
