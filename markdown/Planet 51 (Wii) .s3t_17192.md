- Post Title: Planet 51 (Wii) .s3t

For years, nobody has managed to convert the .s3t texture files that are in the Wii version of Planet 51 and made a tool designed to extract and convert these. I'd like to request a tool that will convert them to a png and/or dds and I have samples zipped in the archive in the attachment.

That's easy. Noesis plugin is in my repo (link below).

Though I can't say for sure it will work with all of the files -- the samples you provided are too similar.
