- Post Title: need help! svr2010 models request

hello I need help please is very urgent
 the reason for my issue is that searching the Internet I found the models to extract wwe smackdown vs raw 2010, well I downloaded the tools x-packer, rrunpack, rroextracter, svredit1.9, so good to extract files from CH.PAC 00.chpac.pac appeared to me more like something, good to open with the x-packer shows me the list of files BPE which I have no idea how to extract

 I just want to extract the 3d models and textures of boe anyone can tell me how, without any programming or other things just like the wrestler 3d model and textures for import into the 3ds Max Studio 2010, and then create mods

 appreciate any help possible, especially how to extract 3D models and textures boe file

 I have x-packer on the rroexporter rrunpack's worth if I want a very useful tutorial thank you very much
