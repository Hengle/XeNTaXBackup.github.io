- Post Title: Metal Gear Solid pc .dat .vox

Hi, I am trying to translate the first Metal Gear Solid for pc, which only on psx came out in Italian. I want to make the ps1 files compatible, I am also fine with just decompiling the files, I can also manually edit them if it is not possible to make them compatible.
