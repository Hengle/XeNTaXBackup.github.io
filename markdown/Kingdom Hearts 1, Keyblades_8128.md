You would have to load Kingdom Hearts on PCSX2 in conjunction with a 3D-ripping program, then attenuate the Y-Axis.

Ok, i have investigate, and the thing can just extract the texture with the channels of colors twisted.

i get the one of the Ultima Weapon. and they work AS texture...
but, they are no way to get a decent model using the 3D ripper tool with emu.


so, i RE investigate more, and i found other tool, what allow you to export other things of the iso, ones of them the Weapons, but, they are in other format called "WPN"

and well, with our with out changing the name to mdls, they don't work. our ever open in any viewer KH Viewer,Noesis, Modelviewer. nothing of them.

but, until the moment that data are the most close to be the weapons of KH1...
just the problem it's any have create a viewer/convert our a way for extract/see the weapons until the moment...




PD: i try with the YO keyblade of the KH2...
it's impossible, for be a dummy weapon, the thing have the whole UV Mapping breaker, ever for fix it.
