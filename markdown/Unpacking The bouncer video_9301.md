Well there was Project fao website which released a lot of tools for extracting cutscenes from SQEX games of that era. Final Fantasy X, Kingdom Hearts, Dirge of Cerberus, etc.. but apparently they never did so for Bouncer. 

This is archived version of website, but all of their tools are still downloadable: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070216023 ... t-fao.org/](https://web.archive.org/web/20070216023919/http://www.project-fao.org/)

The Bouncer is mentioned in 2004 in their Parsed Software section, so they must've been working on it at some point, basically it says that Bouncer uses the same format as Final Fantasy X. But 2005 and later versions of the site have no mention of Bouncer so I guess nothing came of it. 
Search for バウンサー on the page : [https://web.archive.org/web/20040519084 ... t-fao.org/](https://web.archive.org/web/20040519084443/http://www.project-fao.org/)

SQEX games of that time were known to have their cutscenes hidden in a special way. They couldn't be extracted with PSScut and any other software wouldn't recognize the video or audio streams for it. Project fao were pioneers in that field, and their tools could extract demuxed m2v & ss2 streams of the cutscenes.
