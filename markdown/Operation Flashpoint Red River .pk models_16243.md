- Post Title: Operation Flashpoint Red River .pk models

I few days ago got in my hands the juicy model files from this old shooter. since there is nothing about the format (.pk) of these models on the Net, I've been trying to research it with hex2obj and tutorials available on this site but I've got zero progress so far.
So it would be great if there is any volunteer to give a helping hand, thanks!
