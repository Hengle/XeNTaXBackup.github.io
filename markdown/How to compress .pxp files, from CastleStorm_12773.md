- Post Title: How to compress .pxp files, from CastleStorm?

Hi guys, i'm trying to translate CastleStorm to my language. And, I extracted the txt.pxp files with the help of a program, CSPXPUnpacker_0.2. that i took in this topic. [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10654](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10654)

But now, i want to compress back the file to .pxp again. If anyoen knows to do, I appreciate! Thx guys, and sorry for the bad english.
