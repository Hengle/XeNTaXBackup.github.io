- Post Title: Is GameAssassin legitimate?

I was wondering if GameAssassin is even legit when it comes to it claiming animations can be ripped, along with music? Every thing I've seen points to the animation ripping not working for anyone whatsoever. It just sounds impossible for a program to be able to do such a thing! In regards to the music, I'm sure that actually works, since it's more realistic than animations. If anyone here's gotten the animation ripper working whatsoever, respond, as I'm a bit intrigued by that claim.
