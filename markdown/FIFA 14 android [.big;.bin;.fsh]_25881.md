- Post Title: FIFA 14 android [.big;.bin;.fsh]

Noesis pllugin for *.bin (3d_model) and *.fsh (image)

example:
obb/models/hiheads.big/158023_1.big :

obb/stadiums/stadiums.big/1-1.big:

also if you need a skeleton, then put it in the same folder with the model.
skeleton path(obb/skin.bin)
but since all models are separated, (head, body, arm, etc.)
I made a small form to create a list of models. to open them all together with the skeleton.
random models with skeleton:(drag&drop file in the listbox)

*textures assigned manually
**qbms script for .fsh/.big [link](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=501540&st=9900#entry81147293) also on google disk [big.bms](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jd25fa_yEy0YanUTKJu53SWdDw57ESR8/view?usp=sharing)
