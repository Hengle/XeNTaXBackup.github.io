- Post Title: Giana's Return's ZDA files

Hello. There is a Giana Sisters fan game called "Giana's Return" which i always struggled to have it game's files. I already asked help on VG Resource two years ago, but the extracted files were unreadable, so i was wondering maybe i could get a better result here.
Here's the thread : [https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-34408.html](https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-34408.html)
Raccoon Sam explained how he extracted the files so maybe this could help.
Here are the files : [http://www.mediafire.com/file/9s076w7hz ... a.zip/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/9s076w7hzpsxvd7/data.zip/file)
