- Post Title: 7DS: Knights of Brittania [10 commandments 3D Model help]

I have downloaded the files for the PS4 Exclusive, Seven deadly sins, Knight of britannia. I am able to unpack them and view what are inside the .PKG files, but when I want to download models/assets, I need a program that can either open/unpack .ASSETS, .RESS, or .DAT files.

I am able to view what are inside the .ASSETS files by using an AssetsBundleExtractor, but I cannot seem to open the files that are within them!
