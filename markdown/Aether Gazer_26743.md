This is a mobile game developed by Warrior Network's Chinese company. I only know that he uses the Unity engine.I've tried opening the game files with AssetStudio, but they all seem to be encrypted.  The models of this game are very beautiful. I hope someone can rip these models.  There is also the official website of the game ([https://skzy.ys4fun.com/](https://skzy.ys4fun.com/))

Here are some sample files I found in the game filesï¼š
