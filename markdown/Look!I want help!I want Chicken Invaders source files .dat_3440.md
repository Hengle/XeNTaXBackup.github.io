uhmm if you write with bold and big chars nobody will spend time reading your post.

anyway the attached script for [QuickBMS](http://aluigi.org/papers/quickbms.zip) should work with all the games available on [http://www.interactionstudios.com](http://www.interactionstudios.com) included that game.

note: don't ask me for the rebuilder
