Hey fellas,
I have ripped GoW II right now. Managed to get the music out, but now I want to get the textures and object files out of the game.
Just don't know how.

Have some slice of a god:

I see that some downloaded the files, but don't give the answer.

An answer would be always nice...

Are those pure 3D models? Seems rather complex.

Yeah,really complex, especially if you don't know how to rip them 8/.

I am really sure they are the model files,since they are the most common one and are names after their functions. Hero1 and so on probably means Kratos you controll.

Or to say, they have the object and texture files in it. There are also command files, but I doubt you can use them for anything 8/

What makes you think that there are textures in there?
Also that strange partition (?!) into part1 and part2 files.

Those guys told that the textures and object files are in there.
Also after using xpert they seem to be the only one who fall into that category. The VPK files are sound files, thos SS files seems to be the movie files and command files for those fatality moves.

As to the part thing.
Like many console games ,the (PS2)game is dual layered so they use different partitions of dividing ''disk-1'' from ''disk-2''.Meaning they have compressed their stuff in one layer and on the other to avoid any disk space-issue.
 It's like merging all 4 FF VII discs from the PSX into one PS2-DVD. That'S probably the reason the game has so great qualities.

? Can't find anything there, those guys have nothing.

Crappy consoles with their crappy restrictions 
For instance, Red Faction Guerilla could look much better, but they already reached the Xbox360's limits.
