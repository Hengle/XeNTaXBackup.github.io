- Post Title: .x Binary Zip/Compressed Format Editor

I'm messing around with Pro Wrestling X and found all the models stacked in together in a single .dat file.  It appears that the header,

```
xof 0303bzip0032
```

means these are Binary Compressed/Zip DirectX .x files/models.  Unfortunately, I've wasted the entire day trying to find a program that will open/import/export/convert this format properly.  Ideally, I want to import these models into Blender, simply move some vertices, and export back into the game (the .dat files' sizes are required to stay the same, but their contents can be edited without issue).  

The only program I could find that will open the model, at all, is fragMOTION, which opens it properly but cannot export the model back out to the same size.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated, example player model file attached.

Thank you for that


I spent some time with the files today, and the game will load uncompressed txt format .x files too.  So now it is just a matter of rebuilding the containers for each edit.


Thank you again
