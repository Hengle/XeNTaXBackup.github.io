is that question about modelling? is the map an entire mesh or multiple meshes. i mean basicly you can boil it down to editing the mesh, deleting geometry until only the parts that you want are left.

You must have that game map already imported in a 3D software I assume right?
If not, just use 3dsMax or Blender and select those polys you want to delete and that's it.

regardless what software you pick the process is the same anyway
