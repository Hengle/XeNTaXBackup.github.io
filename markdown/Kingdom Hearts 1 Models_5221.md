The only one I'm aware of is Yaz0r's dumper. But apparently there is another one somewhere that dumps more than models...but I have no idea where that is.

Thanks. I'll upload some sample files and see what people can do with them.

EDIT: How do you use this for KH1?

EDIT: How do you use this for KH1?

just double click the exe to see options or see readme,

```
kh1_file_dumper.exe kh1.iso KINGDOM.IDX -dT
```

-dT = dumps all files from "nametbl.txt", but only if it exists.
-dN = dump models from *.ard nametables

these options here are bruteforce names:
-dM = dump music files
-dE = dump event files
-dO = dump other files

There isn't a name table with KH1, so I just used -dO.

I've extracted some things, but not it's asking me for a filename, what do I put in?

Both dumpers are designed to dump any filename you enter, all options are optional.
Enter this "menu/sysfont.bin" and it will dump this file.

Regarding KH2 dumps, I have spent some time recently bruteforcing the missing file names. I don't have the figures here, but I have about 80% of all the filenames for KH2 final mix figured out. I will release a new dumper to handle all the files asap.

Great job, you trully are a hero.
If you ever decide to make KH2 version, please let it also be in Noesis plugin form.

I wish everyone here converted their tools into plugins for Noesis, would help keeping everything much simplier and cleaner.

A Dumper and plugin for re:com wouldn't be bad either. The model of Sora is much MUCH better than the one in KH1. I'm not pushing anyone to make one of course.

It's been completely retextured like all the models in KH2fm. The highpoly one doesn't look as weird either, but I doubt that model would be in the game, with all the cutscenes being pre rendered :/

You actually succeeded in dumping the models huh? Are they just MDLX? I'd love to have a look at Marluxia's boss models. But last I remember I tried dumping them and was unsuccessful.

In addition to the world-specific keyblades, I can't extract any of the libretto or obj/WM_Symbol_**.mdlx files from either KH2 USA or KH2FM. Does anyone know why I can't get the new KH2 dumper to work all the way? Does anyone have a copy of the files?

Well, Falo's dumper has become outdated. Yaz0r and kkdf2's dumpers work much better for KH2FM now, and Yaz0r's nametable is full of most of the files, except a few anbs in the eh and eh_l folders like Roxas's keys and Ansem's Guardian, and a few other files that are hard to snuff out. Use those from now on; yaz0r's initially to grab most of the files, and kkdf2's expack1e to grab any specific files.

Well, Falo's dumper has become outdated. Yaz0r and kkdf2's dumpers work much better for KH2FM now, and Yaz0r's nametable is full of most of the files, except a few anbs in the eh and eh_l folders like Roxas's keys and Ansem's Guardian, and a few other files that are hard to snuff out. Use those from now on; yaz0r's initially to grab most of the files, and kkdf2's expack1e to grab any specific files.

If you have any new filenames to be added to the nametable, don't hesitate to pm me those. Searching for them is a very time consuming process on my side, and I would love to have a complete set someday...

Hey Yaz0r, do you by any chance know what Kairi's Keyblade filename is? If you don't have it I'm totally NOT asking you to go search for it or anything! I just thought I'd ask on the off chance that you might have it.   

And sorry if this is a totally retarded question, but do you search for them using a hex editor? I'd love to be able to help you out somehow.

It's a very long and convoluted process. I started with the list of files that are stored in the game exe, then the list of models that is stored in one of those files, brute-forcing some of the variations. I made a modified version of kh2 that would print the name all the files it loads, so I could add those to the list.
Nowadays, I use the fact that all files are stored in alphabetical order on the disc. So if I'm missing the name of one particular file, I can deduce part of its name from the name of the file before and after it, and brute-forcing the rest.
Sound files were brute-forced based on their header.

I found that there were a few animations, like those in eh/n_zz160, that aren't in your file list, as well as a few event pax. So, if there is a list of files you know and a total number of the files you don't know, perhaps a list of ones I've ripped from FM that weren't in your list could help you for some reason.

Thanks for the explanation! It sounds like it's something I wouldn't be able to help with, since I only just recently learned how to copy and paste files stored in uncompressed archives with a hex editor... so I don't have the skill set to do something that advanced.    But if you ever need help with some kind of busywork that takes a long time, but is still stupidly easy, I'd be happy to lend a hand. lol

It worked for me only when I mounted the KH2.ISO with Daemon Tools and used Falo's extractor on this mounted image.

I found them by looking at the ARD files.
Also, your dumper doesn't cover apdx files because it's only for Final Mix. By renaming all the a.fm files in your name table to apdx, you get all the apdx files.

At the present time, you can't. Yaz0r and Revelation are the only ones who have cracked the mdls format, so only they would have any idea as how to view wpn models. They look much like mdls files but without part of their header, and they may all use the same header because of that, so you could try taking the file headers of other, similar mdls files and use them for the wpns.

On another note, I have compared the models of the US and FM versions of KH2 and have a list of most of the models that were changed in Final Mix. However, the list is composed of all the files I have in one folder, so I may or may not be able to type them up. I had to check many of the files to see if they were changed only a fraction of a kilobyte in size.

Yes, that should be the case, shouldn't it? But after comparing the model of the Dream Shield (the one that is floating in Dive to the Heart) and the weapon model (Goofy can get) of it, I can barely see some similarties, although it should be the exact the same model.

I know that the textures for some of the models are changed in the FM version (Riku and Sora both are... Kairi is not. WHY. That's not fair the other two got more detailed textures so why not her.   I don't think the resolution was changed, but they added more details and shadows.) That could account for the tiny tiny change in size, since adding pixels with new colors that were not previously used on each texture might equal a bit more space being taken up. I'm just speculating though.

That was a mistake on my part. All anbs have a letter at the end. What I meant was

where # = 2, 3, & 5
Those are important, because without them, you can't animate N_ZZ010_EV.mdlx, Ansem's Guardian.


On an unrelated note, I have generated the list of MDLX files changed between USA and Final Mix:

Hi, does anyone know if there is IK data in the KH1 model animation section?
I made a fbx exporter for KH1 models and it currently exports mesh + bones + skinning + textures.
The next step would be to export animation, but i think animations are build on IK (inverse kinematics).

The tool can be found on this thread -> [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4501](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4501)

You are correct, KH1 and KH2 use IK to animate the arms and legs of all characters.
I don't really know where the IK chains data are stored, could be in the model data itself, or the animation data.
The animation data contains a simple skeleton for the IK bones, animation tracks for the IK bones and animation tracks for the standard bones not handled by the IK.
The KH1 animation code is relatively large and complicated and the IK solver is done on VU. So if the IK is not standard, it will have to be reversed from there.

How complicated can it be, I'm talking about simply the character's movements, not the attach system and so on..
Animation is stored in separate files from the models, right? I remember KH2 had mset files for animation, but I haven't checked them out yet.

Maybe he means some of the facial animations? Or secondary animation that's affected by a parent bone? (Eg: maybe bones for parts of kairi's lower skirt are affected by parts higher up, which would generate a realistic swish movement that would have taken more time to do by hand.) Same thing could also be applied to characters' hair. Sora and Riku both have so many spikes. lol. If there was a mathematical algorithm or whatever, that told the spike joints which way to move in relation to joints connected closer to the head, it would save a lot of time on animator's parts. Even parts of clothing, like KH2 Riku's collar, or KH2 Sora's many belts. 

Cause when I look at the cutscenes and pay attention to those types of details, every time a character moves slightly so many other parts that are connected to them move in a realistic way, such as their hair, their clothing, etc. When sora walks his hair bounces in time with it, same with his belts and all that. It seems like there must be some way to set up a system that generates that kind of 'reactive' animation, the smaller things that are affected by the larger part's movement. Sure there's parent bones, but they don't cause the children bones to move in a realistic manner like they do in cutscenes. 

I have no clue if those types of animation connections are used by square, but I only knew of them because I saw a tutorial by autodesk for max 9 on setting up stuff like that.

I don't know if that's the case, i think the hair and cloth animation is baked, not generated. But then I could be wrong..
Part of the IK animation must be static, with exceptions such as changing a foot's position to have floor contact.

I had problems dumping KH2.

With the Falo dumper i put the disk into the DVD drive, then set the .bat file to that drive (kh2_file_dumper.exe E:/KH2 -dN), then run the bat but nothing happens

The Yaz0r dumper don't work for me i follow all the steps in this image ([http://kkdf2.sakura.ne.jp/pcsx2lair/usage_kh2dumper.png](http://kkdf2.sakura.ne.jp/pcsx2lair/usage_kh2dumper.png)) and i alter the kh2dump.bat to point to my disc drive... but only extract a random .bin file.

firsak is right, the dumper only work with daemon tools.

KH1 has mset too, just needs the format figured out and a plugin written for Noesis since it already supports the models via plugin.

Which version of KH2 did you use? I think Falo's might only work with the final mix version. I could be remembering things wrong though.

I have no clue either. lol. I'm only just starting to grasp the concept of 'baking' now thanks to maya. First time I saw it mentioned in maya docs I was like '... wut?'

I've discovered that while the anbs in the anm/tt_r/n_zz160 folder don't actually work on N_ZZ160, Ansem's Guardian, they do work on B_EX210, Luxord's playing card.

Hello there! I realize this thread has been down for a good while, but I don't know where else to turn. Anywhere else I asked was unable to help me. Anyway here's the thing... I am using kh1_file_dumper.exe and I am trying to get the Kingdom hearts weapon models out, but I can't. It says something like "options" when I just click the extracter and says things like "-dT" or "-dO" etc. The nametbl.txt to see all the names of the files is under -dO but I can't extract it o.o. I have no idea how to get weapon models from the kh1iso(I'm actually working with final mix) and even if I could, they come out in .wpn format. What do I open that with? and how do I convert it? Please help. I would really appreciate it.

Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? I repeat, is anyone there? Do you copy? Please respond. Over.

Stupid keyshort cut deleted my post... it should be saved with the back button and linked back to post when back button is pressed... lost my post. Hate it when time and prescence is short. Absolutely hate it. fix it soon please! I wasted precious time!

Anyway, this post is not as good, so forgive me if you don't understand. It's the forum's fault.

I have tried to once again extract kh1.iso with the bat Filo?'s .bat file (Kh1 is not final mix). But nothing happens except blank folders in the extract folder.

Here's my files and codes in my traveldrive, all in the same folder.

dumper_from_nametbl.bat

```
kh1_file_dumper.exe kh1.iso KINGDOM.IDX -dT -dN
```

[http://www.mediafire.com/file/m355odbt1 ... ametbl.txt](http://www.mediafire.com/file/m355odbt1noz55h/nametbl.txt)

I cannot find a valid daemon tools without using torrents that could have viruses or a download link that has not expired. Daemon tools website has been deleted, did you know?

Yazor deleted his dumper and website, which is all expired links on the internet from other people

All other dumpers are broken and/or don't work.

Can someone post a mediashare file (must be a NEW post from a verifyiable source) of daemon tools, AND a working Filo?'s dumper for kh1, or Yazor's tool, and link them here?

How can I extract models from cutscenes? There's one model and animation I really want, but the animation is missing from the character...

I don't  use rippers, I use valid dumpers...

Someone please come in really soon. I appreciate the help, thank you.

Falo, could you PM me the source of your tool?
I'm studying the structure of KH1 & KH1FM to make an english patch...
I have some doubts... Can you help me?
Thanks! 

PS: if you won't give the source, can you just tell me some text files name, if you found them?

I've skimmed this thread, but it appears as though the link to the dumper has been removed.  Is there anywhere else that I can find it?  I'm looking to dump KH2 or KH2FM (whichever it works best with), and then wade through the sea of cutscene and battle audio files.

Edit:

I'm not sure if this is totally out of the subject but anyways.
I made a Toolkit for KH2FM, which contains an extractor(with a huge hashlist for now =D ), a patchmaker and a patcher. The patching process is longer than Xeeynamo's b\c it's rebuilding totally the IMG and the IDX(where Xeeynamo was just opening the IDX, finding the file, and replacing it. If a bigger file was selected, it will overwrite some files so that wasn't really a good solution. Anyways ya can found a demo of my Toolkit here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6XFdC9 ... XhBHpEpJEQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6XFdC9Rdno&list=UUoB6KssAf5AQQXhBHpEpJEQ)

Download links:
Executable: [http://www.govanify.x10host.com/_files/ ... oolkit.exe](http://www.govanify.x10host.com/_files/KH2FM_Toolkit/KH2FM_Toolkit.exe)

License: [http://www.govanify.x10host.com/_files/ ... ICENSE.txt](http://www.govanify.x10host.com/_files/KH2FM_Toolkit/LICENSE.txt)

If ya want more help do the command KH2FM_Toolkit -help, it will extract a Readme. It will require the .NET Framework too, normally shipped w/ windows so I think there will be not so much issues with that.

I'm not sure I'll work on KH1, but maybe I'll do a Toolkit for him, that's a possibility. The problem is I never really worked on kh1, and I don't really want to work on him^^
So, I want to say, we'll see

Btw, don't consider that like an ad, I personally don't want to be known, I just want my Toolkit to be known :p It's the best ya can found for now, so that's why^^
Last thing: the HashList isn't complete(there's still ~1.000 nonames for KH2FM), but I'm updating it pretty quickly, so I think the nonames will be an old story in not so long =D

Bye!, GovanifY

Me again, I just finally started to work on kh1, and the IDX format's pretty similar to kh2, see by yourself: [http://govanify.x10host.com/_img/KH1IDX.png](http://govanify.x10host.com/_img/KH1IDX.png)
I'm sure he already been RE but just posting that. I dunno when I'll have a workable version of my KH1FM_Toolkit but be sure I'm workin' on it now!

Glad to help ya, GovanifY

Same as my KH2FM_Toolkit and all my next toolkits: an extractor, patcher, patchmaker + some other bonus features like somes for verify if you have a good dump of the game. I don't includes a full repacker b\c you can repack everything using the patchmaker and the patcher but I could do it. Not THAT complicated. Normally it'll be able to add files into the game too.
Basically it's just extracting the game by reading the IDX and opening a Stream into the IMG or it's patching the game by rebuilding the IDX and the IMG by copying the old one andmodifying the new one by reading my custom patch file format.

Workin' on it, GovanifY

EDIT: Btw, th position of the file KINGDOM.IMG is hardcoded inside the ISO, I dunno why square tried to hide that but anyways, that's pretty annoyin'. If I can found how to have a stream of him, then I can consider the extract thingy as 90% done^^

EDIT2: I don't really have any idea of how to find this file, been a long time I'm searchin' it. I'm still tryin' but square's always screwin' us at the bad timin' ~.~

EDIT3: Found a strange hash into the KINGDOM.IDX. It's E4EB9203. He isn't compressed. Trying to brute-force his name now

EDIT4: I maybe know what is the name of this hash but if this is the one I guess...just WTF

EDIT5: Square, Square, Square...When will you stop to do shits? This hash got for clear name "kingdom.img", literally. Square stored files of the ISO into the IDX, aka the lba of the game. WTF SQUARE

They just hardcoded the files in the iso. Some files like pre-rendered cinematics, the main img etc...which are supposed to be at the root of the iso got a reference into the IDX. I'm trying to make the main core of my soft right now, and this is working pretty well for now. I am able to extract the files kh1 listed on his IDX(with some exceptions)as nonames b\c I don't brute-forced any names for now, I'll try to view how many names from kh1 1.5 got, and adding them on my Hashlist.
I still need to reverse the compression/decompression algo. I'm still hopin' that it's the same as kh2.

Anyways for now, it's working at least =D.

Well my toolkit was only extracting shits, now that I modified it it's extracting the original files and able to decompress them(afaik same as kh2 but still not sure).
Also, not like kh2, the only flag I saw was the flag 0x1, which means that the file is compressed, so there's not any other kind of flags afaik for now, this part's simpler than kh2.

Oh and the structure of the iso was a pain in the ass to be reversed, never had to face somethin' like that before, this thing is just totally stupid >_<.

Anyways, back to work, GovanifY

The patching part should work but, I dunno why, I have always some NullReferences Exceptions and this is annoyin' me as hell ~.~
At least my toolkit will be finished in not so long so that's cool =D(Don't attempt one SUPA fast like my kh2fm one b\c my code's a mess right now)

For anyone who wants here's a way to find manually where's a file in the iso: take the "offset" of the file into the IDX, convert it into BIG Endian, find the offset of the file SYSTEM.CNF(for me it's 8 D000)and do the followin' step: SYSTEM.CNF OFFSET + IDX OFFSET*2048.
You should be able to found the desired file with that.

Ok, I know, this is my 5th post and always forgottin' to use the EDIT button but don't consider this as a spam, in exchange u'll see a (little) part of my source : 3

[http://govanify.x10host.com/_img/KH1FM_ ... RACTOR.png](http://govanify.x10host.com/_img/KH1FM_Toolkit_EXTRACTOR.png)

Yup, the decompression algo's finally finished and, even if he's not fast at all for now, he is working fuck ^3^
Just saying that my Toolkit's mostly finished, just some little things to add and it will be finished =D

EDIT:(I finally used this button)My Toolkit's practically finished, all's workin', you'll not be able to add new files when I'll release the soft, but be sure I'll try to add it quickly. And my code is a mess like always^^"

Hey, here he is my KH1FM_Toolkit's finally released =D 

He is able to extract the game(-extractor command) and patch it using a propriatary patch system (-patchmaker for create a patch file and drag the patches on the soft for patch the game)
/!\The features of adding new files and modifying the ISO aren't inplemented yet, so by default my soft will patch the files linked into the IDX and can't add new files/!\

Download links:
Executable: [http://govanify.x10host.com/_files/KH1F ... oolkit.exe](http://govanify.x10host.com/_files/KH1FM_Toolkit/KH1FM_Toolkit.exe)

License: No need anymore of the license, she is builted inside 

If ya want more help do the command KH1FM_Toolkit -help, it will extract a Readme. It will require the .NET Framework too, normally shipped w/ windows so I think there will be not so much issues with that.

The soft tooked me not so long b\c he isn't really completed but still, he's perfectly workin' for now. I'll try to make it faster, optimize him, and add some functions that are in my KH2FM_Toolkit when I'll got some time


Bye and Enjoy!, GovanifY

EDIT: Found some bugs on the patchin' process, will try to delete them.

Oh, awesome! It's okay, I know how it is to not have time. I need more self discipline but unfortunately I also need the internet to do my work. Bad combo, I should look for some firefox plugin to block certain sites that are time suckers for me when I should be doing productive things.  *cough* youtube/reddit *cough*   Congrats on almost being done with school. I just finished up at uni a couple months back. Terrifying to think I'm now looking for a job and am no longer a 'student' (felt like being a 'student' was one of the core parts of who I was.. for all my life... eh). 

Thanks so much for the tool! I shall try it out.

You're welcome 

And ya, every changes in our life make us fear what's next b\c we have no idea of what'll be the future, when you'll have a stable job, it'll be ok I think.
As for me, I'm passing too much time on Skype, working on random things and random guys. I hope I'll be able to stop that when I'll have a job^^"

Anyways I'll try to update this soft ASAP, but my time is disappearing more and more...I think after this I'll make a GUI of my KH2FM_Toolkit with the 3.0(and a partially rewrote b\c my code's beginning to be a mess like my KH1 one.

Hoping you'll not have a too much buggy soft, GovanifY

Btw when I'm talkin' 'bout random things I'm talkin' 'bout things like this:



Ya, I can now pretty easily modify the loaded part of the textures, and shit likes this.

Thx SoraikoSan for helped me with this mod 
P.S:I'm adding 2/3 things to this soft, trying to have a little bit optimized one, and trying to add something for changing how the game is loading the pic(sorta like a modded previewer)

Already explained that: the patching part is buggy. The padding part isn't working for some reasons and the toolkit is crashing then. As long as the padding isn't ok, the ISO isn't too. Sorry 'bout that.

Well here I'm back, for saying 2/3 things:

I finally get back to work on my KH2FM_Toolkit, and improved most of the functions already available, I added 4 "secret" features too. For the KH1FM_Toolkit just beginned to get back to work on him and...dafuck. I have no idea why this shitty padding isn't working. But I'll not stop before finding out why this isn't fucking working. I'm going to add the features to add new files etc too if I'm not too lazy. I made 2/3 things on other kh related subjects but this will surely not interest you

So here I'm back, driving you insane w/ buggy tools, GovanifY

P.S: I'm getting used to Milkytracker too but this is totally out of the subject so w/e

I already posted about it in a different thread ("Game Archive")
I updated the plugin by revel8n to work with Kingdom Hearts 1.5 HD (endianness)
and it finally showed them kind of properly

How did you get the models to view. I decrypted mine but noesis only sees it as a .dat file that it can't preview. When I try changing the ext. to mdls it still can't see it

first unpacked from mself
2nd decrypted from sdat (using npdtool)
i didnt have to change ext to mdls because it already used it (when removed from .sdat encryption layer)

It's still giving me error messages. I'm getting desperate to see these models. What version of Noesis are you using?

hmm. I'll try using npdtool, but it won't do anything for me. Is there a batch script I need to use? Because otherwise when I open the program it just closes immediately

Here's how I got it to work. Make a bat file for npdtool, like this:

npdtool ds xa_ex_3000.mdls.sdat xa_ex_3000.mdls and run it.

Then take the output file and run it through SDATA_DEC.exe, it will create a .dat file, rename that to mdls.

Make sure that the file you are looking at is .mdls.sdat and NOT _mdls.sdat.

there is no need in using SDATA_DEC.exe as npdtool is already decrypting sdat

I don't  know what you're trying to say. tried that windows didn't know what to do. 

and _mdls.sdat is the 1.5 models
