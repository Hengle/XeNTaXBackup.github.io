- Post Title: wwe raw 2 plugin .fpk

Good night friends
the truth i'm new to this
I really hope you can support me
I would like to import some mods for my classic xbox wwe raw 2 game
I am treating it with the multiexcommander program
But apparently I am missing the plugin since I get the following error message (attached image)
anyone know where i can get the plugin?
waiting for your comments in advance thank you very much
Cheers
