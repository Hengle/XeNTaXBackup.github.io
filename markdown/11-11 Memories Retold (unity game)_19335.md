- Post Title: 11-11 Memories Retold (unity game)

Hello my friend. I want to translate this game into my own language. Location of source files: 11-11 Memories Retold_Data folder. This folder contains .assets, .resS, .resource, and non-extension files. And several folders. I found some texts in files. For example, "This game supports an autosave feature. Please don't turn off your system when you see this autosave icon." is in the level 1 file. When I tried putting '?' instead of '.', there was no change in the game.

Where can I find all the text of the game?
And what can I open them with?
(I tried it with Unity Ex(non-extension and .assets files) and Unity Text(eg. *.-1, *.114 files ).)

Thank you for your help in advance.

If your text is not compressed or encrypted,
you can just use total commander to find text.
