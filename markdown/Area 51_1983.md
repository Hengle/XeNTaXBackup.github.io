- Post Title: Area 51

Odd, WATTO Extractor says it supports Area 51's .dfs archives, yet it will not extract at all, even if I select to open the archive with the Area 51 plugin. Which brings me to my game request for MultiEx Commander. 

EDIT: THOUGH FIXING WATTO EXTRACTOR IS JUST AS GOOD.

There are seven music/sound archives in Area 51:
 - AMBIENT.000
 - HOT.000
 - MUSIC.000
 - VOICE.000
 - VOICE.001
 - VOICE.002
 - VOICE.003

All of these archives have similarly named .dfs archive, which probably house the directory and specific file information.
 - AMBIENT.dfs
 - HOT.dfs
 - MUSIC.dfs
 - VOICE.dfs

Both *.XXX and *.DFS archives have been cut to 500KB zips.

*bump*

Any progress? I've noticed now that mytempdir doesn't have a very long time that it keeps files on its server, so tell me if you need the files reuploaded via a different upload server or something.

EDIT: Updated. Files have now been permanently moved to my Google account, so they won't be going down any time soon. Is any work still being done on this?
