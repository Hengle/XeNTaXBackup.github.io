Mafia 3 models tool
All bodies and clothes are stored in separate SDS files. You can combine them all you want.

Characters are stored in /combinables/ dir, extract them with [this script](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/mafia_sds_ps3.bms). It will not work with all SDS, so maybe Luigi will improve the script.
After extracting, you'll get many DDS files, and some .DAT files, most of which are models. Drop .DAT files on this tool and it will produce .ascii and .smd formats. Note that only SMD heads and panties contain skeletons, so you must connect the other parts to the same skeleton.



The current version will also work with weapons, cars, and even some map props, but car skeletons will be broken in most cases, because I need to implement bone remapping.

I haven't had the chance to try the tool out but he says in the OP it kicks out smd and ascii files. You should be able to Google a working smd importer for your version of Max. Alternatively, Noesis either loads smd by default or you can look for an smd plugin (i can't remember which) and use it to convert to something like fbx which Max should import just fine. 

Ascii format has scripts for blender mostly. The 2.49 version being a long time mainstay but there are also versions for newer Blender  releases. The Max scripts I've seen aren't as good.

Hey Daemon1 I'm trying to figure out how to play as vito. Which files do I replaces? I tried replacing the "he_head_000_he_head_000.sds" with "ma_head_019_vito_ma_head_019_vito.sds" but no changes show up in game. Can you lend me some advice?

No, I was not going into details which parts used where. Just reversed model format.

Yeah I was just wondering if it's possible to play as other models in Mafia 3. On another forum someone said they got to play as vito by swapping Lincoln's model. I just commented if it's really possible to do that. Mafia 2 was easier to play as a NPC since all the models were stored in Mafia II\pc\sds\player but for Mafia III it's Mafia III\sds_retail\combinables. Unfortunately in Mafia 3, the models aren't labeled specifically for each character, so it's a hassle trying to find all the right parts for Lincoln.

daemon1, this is looking good, is it using a different tool to the individual assets.

I've successfully used the scripts and your tool to unpack some of the city blocks and then individually import separate smd into max, but thats bringing all of the individual buildings in at 0,0,0 and smd import script seems to bring everything in completly unwelded and in some buildings with incomplete meshes.

Would be really interested in your workflow for bringing these more complete blocks in and the usefulness of the final meshes in whatever package you are viewing them.

Any thoughts on making a Mafia 2 Map Viewer like the Mafia World Viewer by ASM made for Mafia 1?
Also giving function to import/export content? There has been alot of research done on .sds (.sds is a file package) and their functions.

People already managed to import map content to Mafia 2 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dmzs1guwN4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dmzs1guwN4)

The tool works with some Mafia: Definitive Edition character models like Tommy and Sarah, but for some reason I couldn't get it to rip the DAT files from Paulie's SDS archives. Upon dragging the dat file into the models tool a blank command prompt window shows up and it ends up with nothing at all. :/

Here's a link to the Paulie SDS files I was attempting to rip from:

Could you share source code for that tool if you don't plan to finish it?
