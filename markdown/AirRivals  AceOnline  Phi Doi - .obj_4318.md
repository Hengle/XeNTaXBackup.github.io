- Post Title: AirRivals / AceOnline / Phi Doi - .obj

All three are basically the same game published by different companies under a different title.

The game is an MMO 3D Space Shooter, it was developed by MasangSoft and is owned by Yedangonline.
In Europe it was published by GameForge4D, in North America by Wicked Interactive, in Vietnam by VTC Online

A download link can be found at [http://www.airrivals.net/main/download](http://www.airrivals.net/main/download) . The game is freeware, it provides great bonuses to players investing money into credits though.

My question is how to open (and modify) the .obj files in the "Res-Obj" directory. They seem to contain a 3D-Model and the according textures (.TGA).
I managed to extract the .TGAs with dragon-unpacker's HypeRipper.

Jaeder Naub manages to extract some DirectX files but they seem unusable.

Here is an example of such an .obj archive file which belongs to the M-Gear, a support air fighter.
[12421100.obj.MGear - 3.52MB](http://www.zshare.net/download/7483051373764abb/) (the ".MGear" part is added by me)

Thanks in advance!
