- Post Title: PvZ Garden Warfare 2 [Frostbite engine] sb,toc,ect.

This could probably be used as a megathread for people who want to actually use this but i want to know on how to break the game.
i mean that by messing with files found in the game's files like garden or graveyard ops wave's stuff but i don't know how as there's no viable way of getting to it.

none of these are usable.


all of the files i can find inside a sb file


all of the files i can find inside a toc file *oddly similar.*


there's also the starting level which you play at the start of the game.


which on the otherside you CAN edit.





so is there any way of being able to get through these for messing around with the code? because i know there's some stuff that could be useful.
it'd probably help the most of us in the end so it'd be better to answer these questions rather than having them build up *even though it's not often.* overtime and have just alot of questions regarding this. *and if people want to discuss maps, models, textures. ect go ahead.*
