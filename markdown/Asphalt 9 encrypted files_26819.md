- Post Title: Asphalt 9 encrypted files

Hello, so i wanted to extract the sound files from asphalt 9 however after extracting the so.pack file i found out that the files were either encrypted or compressed heres a sample: [https://mega.nz/file/wER0nAaT#nK9refvEJ ... pJ-4khLV4c](https://mega.nz/file/wER0nAaT#nK9refvEJineP7_nNUbOCoVKhmBrynLzWpJ-4khLV4c)

Does anyone know how decompress it or decrypt it?
