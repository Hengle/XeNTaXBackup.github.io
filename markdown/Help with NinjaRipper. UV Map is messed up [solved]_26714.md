- Post Title: Help with NinjaRipper. UV Map is messed up [solved]

Hi!   
I've been ripping models from a game with NinjaRipper and the meshes come out fine but the UV map on them are always screwed up. The UVs mostly looks like lines or weird triangles. (I am using 3ds Max for my 3d Program btw but I do have Blender)
I researched a bit and was told to force rip and hope to find a version with the correct UVs. I tried that as well and went through all the meshes and still nothing.

Is there any way to fix this or am I out of luck? 

Screenshot of weird UV compared to the Mesh: [https://imgur.com/a/ynTGtmT](https://imgur.com/a/ynTGtmT)

Any help would be greatly appreciated! The meshes in the games are so pretty but the UV is just causing trouble!

Nevermind, I'm dumb!
I imported the .rip models through Noesis and they have proper UVs now!!

When you download Ninjaripper, there is a folder inside called "Tools" 
There should be a folder for Noesis Importer and inside is Python script. 

Move that script into the plugin folder of Noesis and it'll be able to open  .rip files!
