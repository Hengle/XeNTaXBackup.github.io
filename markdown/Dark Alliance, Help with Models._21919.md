- Post Title: Dark Alliance, Help with Models.

Hello, first of all im a complete newb to coding, extracting, and altering things. 
I recently tried to create some pictures of one of my old favorite game, Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, specificly the Bugbear creature, however when i open the file used for Bugbears in the Rom PS2 for Dark alliance in World Explorer it only shows the full armored version of the Bugbear with helmet however im trying to create a image without the helmet (In the game there are default models without the skull helmet). Im wondering if any of you have any experience with this and can help me out on how to remove the helmet? Can provide you with the files for the creature model aswell if needed.
