- Post Title: Sonic The Hedgehog 4 - Episode #1 .brsar

This game seems to be packed differently to most WiiWare games I think.

I followed a guide to extract the music and I got a "data.cpk" file. I then used HCS's utf tab tool to extract the .cpk file and got a heap of folders with files in them.

Now a lot of these files are ".AMB" files. In the sound folder I have a single .CSB file (which I extracted with the UTF tab tool and got a lot of files with extensions _aif and _wav) and a .brsar file that I can't seem to extract. :\

I tried extracting them using both brsar unpacker and ripping mama but both failed saying "I don't get it".

Here's the .brsar file. See if one of you can help me out.

I tried to rip this game yesterday and it turns out the brsar is full of sequences compared to the 360/PS3 version that has streams.

Can you elaborate any further? I can't do anything at this time still but maybe someone else with more knowledge than me can.

I've ripped the Xbox 360 version and I'm going to rip the PS3 version as well to see if there are any differences.

No way to play wii sequences at the moment unless you emulate the game with dolphin. If you ripped the 360 version, the PS3 version should be the same if you ripped AAX files but I suggest looking into it anyway just to make sure.
