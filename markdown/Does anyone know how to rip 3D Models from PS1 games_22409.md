- Post Title: Does anyone know how to rip 3D Models from PS1 games?

I'm working on a remake of a game is a personal project, and it would be great if I could access the original models as a reference. Link to a tutorial would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance![krogerfeedback](krogerfeedback.com%20survey)

It depends heavily on the game.
The PS1 had some common formats, but a large number of games also used their own compression techniques, so even if they used the standard model and texture formats, first you need to get them out of the compression, which is usually a bit complicated depending on the game.
The game might also use its own custom format, it depends what the game is really.
