Does anyone know how to edit this .pak file? I suspect it contains the text files of the game.
I can't even find info on it as what engine the game uses.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Seems encrypted

Edited: just xored zip

```
get SIZE asize
log "decrypted_file.dat" 0 SIZE 
```

Code: Select allfilexor "\x29\x61\x53\x33"
get SIZE asize
log "decrypted_file.dat" 0 SIZE
So I should use aluigi's xor to decrypt and then just unzip with eg. 7-zip?

Like this?
xor.exe scripts.pak scripts2.pak \x29\x61\x53\x33

Use Aluigi's QuickBMS.

I made similar script. Can be used to pak -> zip and vice versa.

```
filexor "\x29\x61\x53\x33"
get SIZE asize
get NAME basename

if SIGN == "PK"
 string NAME += ".pak_new"
elif SIGN == "y*"
 string NAME += ".zip"
else
 cleanexit
endif

log NAME 0 SIZE
```

I made similar script. Can be used to pak -> zip and vice versa.
Code: Select allgetdstring SIGN 2
filexor "\x29\x61\x53\x33"
get SIZE asize
get NAME basename

if SIGN == "PK"
 string NAME += ".pak_new"
elif SIGN == "y*"
 string NAME += ".zip"
else
 cleanexit
endif

log NAME 0 SIZE

works, even as a repack. made my very first mod, and I think the first mod for the game, with this

Hey guys.

Did something change?

In new version of game I cannot open the unpacked .zip files (with xor x29x61x53x33 from above)?

Am I doing something wrong? Here is file from new game (.zip extension is only so I can upload the file, this is .pak file!):
[lair_save.pak.zip](https://xentaxbackup.github.io/file/11077_lair_save.pak.zip)

New XOR key: 
```
\x33\x29\x61\x53
```

You used BMS script for decrypt .pak to .zip.
Then you extracted that zip file.

Pack all extracted files into new zip, and use the same BMS script on it.
