Hi guys
The script of BMS Aluigi to extract files from an archive VIS3 does not work with the data file of the demo of the game Deponia.
[http://www.mediafire.com/?x35n8kp65htcp0m](http://www.mediafire.com/?x35n8kp65htcp0m)
Is this someone smarter than me   could tell me why this script does not run either an archive VIS3

Best Regards

Thanks for the script, aluigi. You did great work as always. 


Unfortunately it seems that developers use different "keys" each time. I stumbled upon other Visionaire VIS3 file with different key. Please, could you be so nice to check it?
I can send you the link or post the link here for a short time.

would be cool to have a key database in the script.
considering that the "encryption" is just a plain xor maybe it's possible to do something even using only the archive without exe debugging.

let me know all the vis3 games you encountered and which are unsupported by the script.
if you have also some sample files they are welcome :)

to anyone:
I need the vis archives of any game not yet supported by visionaire.bms
the smallest archive or its first 1 megabyte or less is more than enough.

note: Dark Eye is already supported in my beta so I don't need it

I have updated the script with new keys, other will be added when will be encountered unsupported archives:

I can recover the keys on the fly, it's really funny :)
