- Post Title: Extracting .BANK for sound contents

Can I have some assistance, if possible, please? I have located a .BANK File that I would like to extract the sounds contents of. However, I am unsure how to do this. I have provided the link below of the file. It is a "sound mod" for a particular car. I'd very much appreciate any help on this.
