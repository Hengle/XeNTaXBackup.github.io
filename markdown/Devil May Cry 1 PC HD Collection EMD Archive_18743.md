- Post Title: Devil May Cry 1 PC HD Collection EMD Archive

Hello I am keen to see the contents of Devil May Cry 1 PC, the Textures and Sounds I Have extracted using scripts and Dragon Un-packer. I would also like the models but I cannot access them without a script for the archive which are .EMD. I would be very grateful if someone could take a look and perhaps create a BMS Script or any script which can open EMD's   . I have named several of them and know from dragon unpacker which ones hold which enemies. 

Thank You
