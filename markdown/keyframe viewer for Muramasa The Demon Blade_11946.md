- Post Title: keyframe viewer for Muramasa: The Demon Blade

Hi, guys
    I have figured out how to put the texture pieces together to build a complete keyframe. and I write a viewer to view these art works frame by frame. I'll share my scripts after I cleanup my code. Below is a screenshot:
    


Raijin with wireframe ON. raijin.jpg (240.82 KiB) Viewed 119 times



    All the art works, include the scene, 2d character model, effects, and gui are all made in the same way. I'm really shocked.Also, it has a switch to toggle wireframe on/off. Their artists are really amazing, various effects are made up using simple images with a 4-triangle quad and vertex color.
   It seems that i can only upload one attachment,   

   by the way, I have looked into the same files in dragon crown, and find that they are really similar. There's a high chance I can figure those out too.

Can you share your code? I need to it.
