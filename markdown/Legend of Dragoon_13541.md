Hello 

I'm new here

Hello guys

Does anyone have offset rom for change value HP/MP and STR DEF...etc, I'm search but I don't found it..?

I found only modifier treasure items

Burn Out: Ch.1 Serdian War Seles Item Box Modifier:0C4F7ED8

Charm Potion: Ch.1 Serdian War Forest Item Box Modifier:0C1F8818

Spark Net: Ch.1 Serdian War Hellena Item Box Modifier:0DB4770C

Lether Jacket: Ch.1 Serdian War Hellena Prison Item Box Modifier:0CBB98F0

Angel Prayer: Ch.1 Serdian War Hellena Prison Item Box Modifier:0CBB8DC8

Is that game protected by compressor files or something else ? 


I found everything in memory/quick save, Like state Dart and shopkeeper...etc then I search in rom iso/bin file but I don't found anything I tired...I think that is  game protected by compressor files but you can found some gaps little like what I found we need tool for uncompressor file I think.
