- Post Title: Smackdown 2 Know Your Role (Can anyone extract the models?)

I've been following everything since its been discovered that textures can be extracted from the later smackdown games. I am very interested in learning if the same is possible with SD!2. I found that the .bpe files in the C2.PAC and the DENT.PAC can be extracted. I would like to see if someone could extract the head models from ED1.PAC, in which I believe hold the actual head models of the wrestlers in game.
