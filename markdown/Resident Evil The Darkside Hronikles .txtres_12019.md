The format seems straightforward enough...

```
{
    char magic[4] = "TRES";
    int version;
    int entryCount;
    int unknown; // 16
};

struct entry
{
    int messageIndex;
    int keyTextOffset;
    int type;
    int valueTextOffset;
    int reserved1; // always 0?
    int reserved2; // always 0?
};

struct main
{
	header h;
	int entryPointers[h.entryCount]; // offset to entries
	entry entries[h.entryCount];
	// null terminated string array
};
```

And you can write the script BMS?

The file isn't exactly an archive; it's a collection of strings with a bit of metadata. QuickBMS can probably do operations to dump everything to text, but you're really better off finding a more general purpose scripting language to use for exporting and importing.

I need to extract the text in TXT, translated into Russian and back pack in .txtres. In general, I want to make a translation of the game on the Russian language.

9 years later?   I'm sorry, but you're too late. (I don't even know what that script or app did exactly.)
