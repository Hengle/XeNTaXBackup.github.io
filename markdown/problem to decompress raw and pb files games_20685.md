- Post Title: problem to decompress raw and pb files games

Hi I'm French 

I would like to extract the textures and sprites of this game:

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta ... ogle&hl=fr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zeptolab.cats.google&hl=fr)


But it seems that they are raw files compressed with some of the .pb files.

I tried using QuickBMs and Neosis scripts d'un ancien post, but i  not had answer.

[Https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php? ... ab#p130113](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=16206&p=130113&hilit=raw+files+zeptolab#p130113)

But without success...

I have a piece of zip file containing sample files as well as the log of quickbms and neosis.

Can someone help me ?

thanks in advance.
