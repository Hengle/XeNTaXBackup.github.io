> Which is the best book for using 3D Studio Max? I am looking to get into the saddle of some 3D rendering software (namely 3D Studio Max), and I was wondering what the best published companion would be to this program in order to enhance my use of it. Or if you know some very thorough online tutorials, that would be helpful; however, a book would be preferable.
You'll most likely be disappointed in the quality of instruction in just about any book or tutorial. There are always a step missing or a feature ignored or simply just badly written explanations...

That said, you can still learn a lot (if you do a bit of experimentation with the steps that are missing).

I learned most of what I know about Max from video tutorials.

I forget where I found it but there was one really good tutorial for making a Joan of Arc character model.
