Im trying to extract data from game .cab files.  Is Winzip the only way? Cant I use Winrar? I here you can use Microsoft System Config. Utility, but I dont know how to access that. Thanks for the help!

why not just using 7zip:

it works even with some installers and obviously all the various gz, zip, rar and other compressed archives
