- Post Title: WRC 9 - Textures PTX and P3d mesh

Hello everyone,

I try to read/mod/convert PTX texture on WRC9 and unfortunately i can't do it. 
I've nom knowledge on python script. 
I'm searching for a simple tool which convert PTX to DDS for adding texture on cars as I can add drivers on existing team.
My aim is to add also cars on this game. 

Did anyone know how tout convert WRC9 ptx?
