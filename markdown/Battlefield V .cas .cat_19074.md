Hello,

I would love some help extracting the sounds/audio. The game apparently uses Frostbite 3. And everything is packed in these .cas files as you can see in the image below:



I tried a couple of Python scripts that were written for Battlefield 1 but none of them worked or I couldn't make them work.

Here's that last cas_07.cas 20mb file for testing. Oh and the cas.cat catalog just in case.

Thank you very much!

I tried Luigi's Frostbite TOC/SB script on this cas.cat file, and it extracted roughly 3.9GB out of those 4.6GB. The extracted files always start with "00 01 00 00 00 71 00 00", so I guess that's the header. I recognized some PNG headers inside some of them, so I guess they are not compressed. However, I don't know what to do with those files, since fb3decoder and ealayer3 decoders don't work.

Well, here's another problem. Encryption has changed. Patch folder and .sb files are missing.I already tried to do something, but nothing but two sounds. And one sound is from Bf1, and the other I do not know from where.

To those of you who do not know yet, a new python script that supports the new format for SWBF2 and BFV has been created by the dev of FrostyToolSuite and someone already posted it [here](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=40429#p40429).
Now you can dump the whole game again to your own pleasure.

And by the way for those who want to unpack sounds. There is a problem with EASpeex. The script can not find : EASpeex dll not detected. Although I have it and it is in the folder. This happened when I reinstalled Python for version 2.7.6. And I wanted to load Battlefield V into FrostyToolSuite editor  and I was not lucky

Yeah after like 3 hours of unpacking I also cannot seem to extract the sounds :< It's just a 60 gigs of .chunks

You are have 60Gb chunks? This is BFV or SWBF2 ? Just in BFV, there are generally very few chunks formed (250 chunks) <500Mb. All the same for BFV need to refine the script.

Alright I think I did it. You need Python 2.7.6, that's very important.

First use the x64 version of Python to extract the chunks and everything else. Then install the x32 version of the same Python 2.7.6 and use the script called fb3decoder.py. To basically extract/convert the sounds using all the .chunks and .ebx files that you already extracted before.

This is very important, make sure the paths are correct



And if then run the script by pressing F5.

During the extracting and converting you might get some errors like this one



I couldn't fix it so I just moved the file causing the error out of that folder. So if the converting stopped at Wood003, just remove Wood004 and it should continue. But you'll have to restart the script, and it's wise to also remove all of the .ebx files that it already processed out of there too, so it doesn't convert them again. If it doesn't, just keep removing files until it does.

And that's pretty much it. [Here's a little thing I put together really quick](https://puu.sh/C73P3/260a2c452b.wav) :>

I can't dump the files with Python 2.7.6 x32. This is the error log:

Any ideas what I should do? The old dumper for BF1 works with my tools.

The newly updated script by GalaxyMan2015 requires 64bit of python, latest version of python works as well.

Your wrong, the audio decoding process is NOT tied up to that specific python version (those instructions you read in the archive are outdated and inaccurate from a different python script), yes it has to be 2.7 and not 3.x.x, BUT it will work with anything between 2.7.3 32-bit up to latest 2.7.15 32-bit versions of python.
The only thing changed on the newly dumping python script is that it requires python 2.7.3 64-bit up to latest 2.7.15 64-bit

> Reply from Luriam

The main reason your getting those errors is because well, outdated files on, pretty much everything, ealayer3.exe needs latest update by ID-Daemon including it's xas_decoder with its entry inside the python script to be updated, then everything will decode properly.

If it doesn't, just keep removing files until it does.
Do NOT remove anything, you need full dump intact of the game with every EBX where it belongs and its chunk files.
So basically use this decoder script, I updated the proper entry of the decoder, and all should run smoothly, make sure you have correct paths and for the ealayer3.exe too, make sure you use sound folder NOT the whole EBX folder and you're good to go.


 BFVdecoder.zip
(216.34 KiB) Downloaded 233 times


And if you happen to see few errors like this:

```
Error executing Xas_decode.
```

when xas_decode cant decode the old xas.dll will decode it instead that specific audio ebx/chunk.

Also if you think that some sounds might not get decoded/missing, well that could mean they might have added a new format and needs further reversing, who knows what can be the reason, I didn't fully tested every audio, were talking 10s of thousands of files.

have fun

So what should we do ? Does it work well when the folder "initialexperience" is deleted even if it tooks full ram ?

As if the system itself reserves from my 16 GB to 2-3 GB, but I'm afraid the plate may boil, because nothing happens, but the memory modules are still under 15.7 GB clogged. I think maybe this is the version of python, but I try everything I can

As far as I know the raw files not only are highly illegal/DMCA stuff, but there is no such lossless sound/music in the game, they where already encoded by the devs during game development thus no longer lossless, at best you can just grab the scripts make sure you have correct settings/paths and dump game, then decode music yourself, you really have every bit of information already available.

Huh, how did you end up having such an error based on the script baffles me, but, lets take one step at a time.
You used old script, new one was slightly modified by GalaxyMan2015 to support latest updates, did you used correct paths, did you enable necessary parameters, there for, lets begin.

First you need to install python, versions between 2.7.3-64bit up to 2.7.15-64bit will work, default settings and path installation is fine, after that you need to grab last updated script, I named the .zip 2nd to know which one people are using to avoid confusion in future.


 BFV_2nd_dumper.zip
Updated script about the mentioned error down below. (181 KiB) Downloaded 154 times


After that done right click on: swbf2_bfv_dumper.py
And click: Edit with IDLE
The IDLE window will open and you'll see a bunch of text in green/red/black/blue/orange
Scroll down a bit and on the following strings:
Change bf1Directory = r"[GameDirectory]" to where your game is installed.
Change targetDirectory = r"[OutDirectory]" to where you want to dump the game (make sure its different HDD to speed things up)
Example:

```
targetDirectory   = r"D:\BFV_dump"
```


And then right under those strings above the following should look like this, all set to True,

```
# EVERYTHING ELSE ââ
dumpResEnabled = True
dumpChunksEnabled = True
dumpChunksTocEnabled = True
```


After making sure you set correct paths and settings, hit F5 on your keyboard, click OK when prompted.
Now another IDLE window will open showing all game assets being dumped in blue strings, just let it run.
Once you will see this >>> as last line means its done, it can take between tens of minutes to even more than an hour, or if you have an old computer half a day, so be prepared regardless.

Now that you have whole game dumped, audio decoding is next.
Now make sure you uninstall that python 64-bit and now grab the 32-bit this time, because the required components do not support 64-bit, and install it same way you did the other one.
Get the BFVdecoder script posted here on previous page: [viewtopic.php?p=146185#p146185](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=146185#p146185)
And make sure the following are changed accordingly, don't touch anything else, unless you know what your doing of course.

```
targetDirectory     = r"X:\YOUR PATH GOES HERE"

ealayer3Path        = r"X:\YOUR PATH GOES HERE\ealayer3.exe"
```

As you can see the steps are similar just different scripts, you get the idea.

PS: these steps work assuming you have a legit copy of the game with files intact and not corrupted, with their required file/folder structure, this is 100% procedure for 100% success rate, period, no other errors occur if everything done right.
Just be patient and follow through every step.

have fun

Huh, how did you end up having such an error based on the script baffles me, but, lets take one step at a time.
You used old script, new one was slightly modified by GalaxyMan2015 to support latest updates, did you used correct paths, did you enable necessary parameters, there for, lets begin.

Ok now the problem i ran across is this: 

for installChunk in layout.installManifest.installChunks:
        catFile=root + "\\Data\\Win32\\" + installChunk.name + "\\cas.cat"
                 if not(installChunk.name.startswith("installation/default")):
            catalogs.append(root + "\\[PATH]\\Win32\\" + installChunk.name + "\\")

It said theres an error in your program: unexpected indent. That indent is right before it says "if not(installChunk.name.startswith("installation/default")):

You have every necessary needed tools to do that yourself, don't beg for actual game files, those are illegal, own the game and play with to your own hearts content in your own privacy.
And do NOT quote the whole freaking comment, your making a mess.

> Reply from BRAGme

Make sure you at least include an error as such in a code not as text as it gets scrambled, like this:

```
        catFile=root + "\\Data\\Win32\\" + installChunk.name + "\\cas.cat"
		if not(installChunk.name.startswith("installation/default")):
            catalogs.append(root + "\\[PATH]\\Win32\\" + installChunk.name + "\\")

```

An also a screenshot explains better what is going on, even code mode for text messes up the lines, but since I know what is that error about all you have to do is remove those two tab spaces and your good to go, like this, see the difference?

```
        catFile=root + "\\Data\\Win32\\" + installChunk.name + "\\cas.cat"
        if not(installChunk.name.startswith("installation/default")):
            catalogs.append(root + "\\[PATH]\\Win32\\" + installChunk.name + "\\")

```

But it clearly seems your doing something wrong with your selected game path, so that is NOT a script error, its a error caused by your path selection, like it cant access it to move forward.

But if you cant find it means you have a pirated version, or borrowed files from a friend or something, because with out it the process will never be able to continue.

There's clearly something wrong with your files, no error occurs on a retail copy of the game form Origin, with files/folder structure intact, period, everything works smooth.
I'm afraid you'll be on your own from now on to discover what is your doing wrong, your game files are incomplete, and obviously not having latest version.

This script works perfectly.

Don't forget ! You must use a python 32-bit software to extract audio files when you have ebx, chunk files.
The texture tool also works (res files are indispensable).

Once again another example of no one reading anything or doing a bit of research, literally nothing, anyway.
He does NOT have a problem with the script, in the end was all about incomplete files and wrong file/folder structure, if you would have paid attention on previous posts I used already the last script updated by GMan.
And what needs to be done to achieve accurate results, so on and so forth.

It is odd none the less giving the fact its simply the same updated script by GMan, and it works smooth on my end with original game files, yet looking at them both side by side it seems that bfv_dumper_fix_2.1.py has some spaces/tabs/indentations adjusted, yet makes no sense why you where unable to dump since its still original untouched script.

It works if you have the rest of the DLCs/Extra content the game has otherwise it will not continue with extraction.
Usually these games extract smoothly as long as people have complete files, otherwise you'll have to remove files from folder structure in order to progress.
Basically your missing Expansion Packs that the game has, plus their required updates.
The game has 4 XPacks and you've reached first one that is missing.

It can take between 40min up to 9h+, that varies based on multiple factors, such as location of both game and dump, HDD or SSD so on and so forth.

For demo of a new frostbite game they seem to have changed the structure again. The manifest seems to be missing from layout.toc. I get the following error in python:

> Traceback (most recent call last):

When I do the following:

```
    l = dir(layout)
    print l
```


I get :

```
['__doc__', '__init__', '__module__', 'fs', 'get', 'head', 'installManifest', 'superBundles']
```


So ... no manifest to read from.

Yes its already known, the script is useless because its a completely new format that it does NOT involve cas.cat files anymore, I am sure sooner or later someone will come up with something, until then I'd suggest to not post any game files because the game is not officially out yet.
The devs can change their mind and screw things up more for us, if you know what I mean.

I'm only interested in the audio but followed the instructions to dump everything to avoid issues. I've tried dumping to different disks and still it stops in the exact same spot. Mono or anyone else has any idea why this is happening?  Thanks in advance!

I was able to extract all chunks and ebx files, but no res due to the error in my previous post. I looked at the BFVdecoder.py and there is no mention to any res... is it really necessary? 

Anyway, I tried to decode and nothing happens:

```
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
>>> ================================ RESTART ================================
>>> 
XAS1 dll detected.
EASpeex dll detected.
EALayer3 tool detected.
>>> 
```


Any ideas?

The BFV audio script is not working with SWBFII game to decode audio. Assuming that's the game your working on.

Yes, Star Wars Battlefront II. Is there any other script that is working? I had partial luck with this one [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... perFix.rar](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/485815052025462796/521301222733381632/BFVDumperFix.rar) the script inside the Audio folder decodes 33 WAV files (Titan mode music) out of 18,000 files. Here's how it looks like:



Files inside green rectangles were decoded. Red ones (the vast majority) nothing happened. Any ideas?

Not sure what you mean by embedded, their just inside the cas/cat archives.
If I remember correctly they should all be VP8/WEBM videos.

BTW, you didn't properly embedded my message in to CODE and I got sooo confused lol.

As Frosty dev said numerous times, Frosty will never be used for mass extraction of any kind, you need to use the python script to dump them, or any other asset for that matter.
And to be honest I don't think Frosty supports the extraction of cinematic videos.

Hello All. I have been a long time lurker and have benefited from the excellent tools and advice on this forum. For a while, I have been able to extract BFV sound data into wav/mp3 but since the recent 6.0 patch (as of 9th, Feb. 2020), I no longer can. 

I wonder is it the patch that is at fault or just me forgetting a crucial step. It might also be the BFV Dumper that is faulty in the first place and not a problem with the BFVdecoder. All tools used are up to date (to the best of my knowledge) and running on the correct python versions.

It seems that I can dump the BFV data just fine but when running BFVdecoder, I consistently get this error:

```
XAS1 dll detected.
EASpeex dll detected.
EALayer3 tool detected.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "D:\BFV Dump Tools\BFVdecoder\BFVdecoder.py", line 540, in <module>
    main()
  File "D:\BFV Dump Tools\BFVdecoder\BFVdecoder.py", line 537, in main
    dbx.decode()
  File "D:\BFV Dump Tools\BFVdecoder\BFVdecoder.py", line 398, in decode
    for i in self.prim.get("$::SoundDataAsset/Chunks::array").fields:
  File "D:\BFV Dump Tools\BFVdecoder\BFVdecoder.py", line 169, in get
    raise Exception("Could not find complex with name: "+str(e)+"\nFull path: "+name+"\nFilename: "+self.dbx.trueFilename)
Exception: Could not find complex with name: $::SoundDataAsset
Full path: $::SoundDataAsset/Chunks::array
Filename: Sound/PlaceholderDummy_Casablanca
>>> 
```


Could it be a faulty dump (I have dumped the files twice to check) or has something changed with the update? Thank you in advance.

I'm having the EXACT same error, unfortunately just like you I can't tell what's the problem here: the dumper or the decoder. 

Hopefully someone will update them to work with the latest version of the game.

It's either that or both of us are making the very same mistake lol

I'm getting the same error as zestoflemon, Sebastiel, and BRAGme. Does anyone have access or knowledge to create an updated decoder script for the latest version of BFV?

I finally solved the problem in which the script could not "find complex with name: $::SoundDataAsset"
I'm a noob in programming/coding so this took me hours.

Anyway i converted some bf4 and bfV .ebx sound files to .txt files in order to compare them, after all the audio decoder works fine with bf4 .ebx files.

The python script tries to reach the Chunk datas with the given path but since the recent bfv updates the path has changed as you can see. 

"$::SoundDataAsset/Chunks::array" has to be replaced by "$::SoundWaveAssetBase/$::SoundDataAsset/Chunks::array"

That is a nice find, i haven't messed with these Frostbite games in so long, will give it a try myself, had no clue there was an issue before, hm.

PS:
Although i'd normally do NOT recommend those decoders any more since at the time they where the only solution available, and results where not always accurate, and ever since these: https://github.com/NicknineTheEagle/Frostbite-Scripts have become available, the rest of old stuff has rendered obsolete.

Will this work on Star Wars Squadrons? I want to get some certain files for personal reasons. And is there even a tutorial that I can learn from this step by step?

The above link ONLY works for audio extracted AFTER the game has been dumped first with the old SWBFII script, as both games share same structure as BFV.

A common problem with the latest BF5 updates downloaded via the origin platform. Honestly, many players are just tired of developer errors that prevent you from performing any actions with the game, I have it started to hang and lag very much that even my skill does not help to play. So I took and downloaded the cheats from [wallhax.com/hacks/battlefield-5/](https://wallhax.com/hacks/battlefield-5/) to play and after a couple of updates do not go into this game anymore. BUT I enjoyed playing with cheats so much that now it's a great pleasure for me, I do 13 kills per game. I think this is a very good result for such a level of play as I have. I advise developers to fix their errors.

For demo of a new frostbite game they seem to have changed the structure again. The manifest seems to be missing from layout.toc. I get the following error in python:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "E:\dontmatter\swbf2_bfv_dumper.py", line 830, in <module>
    processManifest(bf1Directory)
  File "E:\dontmatter\swbf2_bfv_dumper.py", line 732, in processManifest
    fileRef = ManifestFileRef(manifest.file)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'file'

When I do the following:
Code: Select alllayout = cas.readToc(root + "\\Data\\layout.toc")
    l = dir(layout)
    print l

I get :
Code: Select all['__doc__', '__init__', '__module__', 'fs', 'get', 'head', 'installManifest', 'superBundles']

So ... no manifest to read from.

Hello i've been trying to look at BF2042 files (im in the tech alpha)
and i get the same result as you.
and like mono24 mentioned : "Yes its already known, the script is useless because its a completely new format that it does NOT involve cas.cat files anymore"
the format must have changed.
Anyone else is working on that? 
i'll look around if some tool for Anthem works in the meantime
Edit: yeah tried a tool for anthem and the file structure seems different too

Some of you have access to the tech demo, lucky boys   
Can you please share some of the bf2042 data files ?

Too risky, you know there are watermark everywhere in game, and i wont doubt they put some inside the files too.
I'm open to advice on how to proceed to extract stuff (i've never done it , but is reasonable tech savy)
for now i tried swbf2_bfv_dumper and anthem tool, didnt work (missing .sb files)
gonna try frosty-toolsuite but i dont have my hopes up

This thing is already out there, spread out all over, it just require some search, that's all.
And no, currently no known script will dump the assets nor frosty, as its a new format structure, it has to be reversed and a new python script created for it.
In time.

Thx for the confirmation.
"This thing is already out there" you mean the actual files ?

The entire folder structure, yes.
