- Post Title: 18 wheeler: pro trucker america .WOB file format.

this forum was so very helpful before I thought maybe I'd try my luck once more.

 I won't waste your time here if I can help it. contained within the file below are trucks and trailers from an oldie but goodie "18 Wheeler: Pro Trucker America." for the nintendo gamecube. oddly enough the gamecube versions directory points right to the mesh files used by the game including the trucks,trailers and stages. I have included only the trucks and trailers as that is all I am concerned with researching at this time.

 the file format is only shown be ".wob" file format though when the format is listed again in windows 7 it's listed as a "WOB" format.

 any help on this format would be greatly appreciated as I have burned my way up and down google trying find out anything about this format that I can.

the files I have hosted here: [http://www.mediafire.com/?thvj6c4a62j0cwj](http://www.mediafire.com/?thvj6c4a62j0cwj)

 thank you all for your time.
