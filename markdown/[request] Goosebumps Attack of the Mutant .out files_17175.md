- Post Title: [request] Goosebumps: Attack of the Mutant .out files

I'd really appreciate it if someone could take a look at the .out files from the game Goosebumps: Attack of the Mutant. I know for a fact they contain character & object sprites, as opening the archives in notepad gives me crude ascii representations of the graphics contained within. The game itself (which is abandonware btw) is a first person shooter made for the PC in 1997 which runs on a graphics engine very reminiscent of the original Doom engine; every character and most objects in the 3D environment are represented with 2D sprites.

I've been working on reversing this game for quite a while now; the .out files were originally packed within a .scr file which i was eventually able to crack open. I'll leave a download link to a zip archive containing a few sample .out files.
