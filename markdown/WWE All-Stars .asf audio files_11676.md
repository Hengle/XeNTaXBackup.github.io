- Post Title: WWE All-Stars .asf audio files

The multi-platform game WWE All-Stars seems to use a codec that doesn't seem to be used very often, at least from searching these forums: .ASF (not to be confused with .AFS). I've trying to extract the audio from it.

I'm not sure if it's an archive or a multi track audio file, but I can't find anything to open it.

I've uploaded 3 PS2 and 1 Wii example of the file if someone can please check it out.

Those PS2 ones are 100% Sony's VAG audio encoding method. Very common with PS2 games.

When I try to open one of the ASF files in PSound it says 'Unrecognized Format, do you want to scan', which I do, and it doesn't find anything.
