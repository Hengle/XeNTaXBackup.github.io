- Post Title: Devil May Cry Character Animations

Hi!

Can anyone please point me in the right direction, I am trying to extract the 3D character animations from Devil may Cry 5.  I saw that there was a way to extract the models and textures from the game but I would like to also extract the animations such as the various moves and combos from Nero and Dante. If possible I'd like to take those animation into 3ds max to mess around with so any guidance on how to do that would be awesome.

Thank you!
