- Post Title: VGMToolbox error while extracting de 7z file contents

Hi.

On a topic I found, I read that using this software you can extract the audio files from a DAT file. Does any of you still have the VGMToolbox zip working? I tried to download it, several versions of the ones on SourceForge but they won't work. 7-zip just keeps throwing up the error "cannot open file as archive" (same error using WinRAR and WinZip). I want to get just the sounds from Xenoblade Chronicles as some of you already could.

Using Falo's script I could get the DAT files from the snd.pkb file. I think that something went wrong when using it because all the DAT files where named with the same name (I chose to rename them automatically) and all of them are displaying a size of 0KB.

I'm new to this ripping stuff. Can you give help me with this and / or give some kind of guide to learn how to achieve this?

Thanks.
