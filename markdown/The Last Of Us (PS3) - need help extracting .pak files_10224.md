- Post Title: The Last Of Us (PS3) - need help extracting .pak files

So, I was able to find a few The Last Of Us files on the God Of War: Ascension disc (for the demo countdown, which was surprisingly in the Naughty Dog engine, which means they left a few small files for an actual demo.)

There were .pak files in there, that have menu images and icons (for multiplayer boosters, weapons, etc.), and various other things.

Somebody here once made a BMS script for extracting DDS files from Uncharted 2 .pak files (link here: [viewtopic.php?f=18&t=6901](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=6901) ), and that script actually works with Uncharted 3/The Last Of Us .pak files, with a modification I made in a reply to that thread (here: [viewtopic.php?p=75303#p75303](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=75303#p75303) ).

As far as I know, The Last Of Us .pak files (at least the ones that I found) are the same as Uncharted 3 ones, because I get similar outputs when I use the script on them.

Now you're probably wondering why I'm asking you guys for help if I got it to work. It's because the outputs from Uncharted 3/The Last Of Us .pak files are really messed up and the script becomes buggy. Here are some examples of extracted files, converted to PNG:

And these are the good quality ones from a lot more files...
(the weapon icons have been fixed in photoshop)

Some of them even look like they're a mix of 2 seperate files:

(the bottom, which is black and white, is most likely from another file.)

So all I'm asking is for someone to edit the original script that I linked to before, and make it work properly for The Last Of Us/Uncharted 3 .pak files.

If you need something to be able to do this, contact me privately.
