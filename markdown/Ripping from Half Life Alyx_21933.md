- Post Title: Ripping from Half Life Alyx

Hey, was wondering if any of you knew about how to rip from Alyx, I already have a model decompiler, but have no clue how to make the .vmdl files into something workable like an FBX.

All the models i've seen from alyx so far have been re rigged, as the only way to rip from it that i've seen working so far is with ninja ripper.

Just an update if anyone is still interested. You can rip the alyx models and textures, bones intact using a tool called Pragma Filmmaker.

Ayyyyyyy, thanks for the heads up, how difficult's the tool to use?
