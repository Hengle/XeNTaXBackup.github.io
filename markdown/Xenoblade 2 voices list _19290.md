- Post Title: Xenoblade 2 voices list ?

Hi!
First of all for mods i'm not asking for the actual files here.
I didn't really find a place where this could go so i just leave it here, if it's the wrong section fell free to move it.
I extracted the audio files from Xenoblade Chronicles 2 to get voices and clean music rips. They came as .nop files, no problem to convert them to .wav
But i'm bad as recognizing voices (file names aren't obvious it would be too easy ^^)
They're located in romfs\stream\voice\us and then a lot of folders. I understood that one folder is for one character, i.e. the 01 folder is Rex
Managed to recognize Rex,Nia,Tora and Zeke but struggle for the others.
I just want to know if there's a list with this information.
