- Post Title: Help modding a Just dance game

The game is titled: Just dance Vitality school, I finally learned how to mod the video files of the game but i have a question about modding 

I use a video file, It used to be stadium flow but now is a diffrent video heres what i need help with:
1. Replacing The Menu stuff, and pictograms 
2. Audio is pitched
3. video is out of tuned
And another thing is how do you access the servers in the game: 3 songs were explored (Gee Bang Bang Bang and Drinking song) in the files but I can't find them, If you know where those files are, Please let me know. I want to find some menu squares, Pictograms, and other stuff before they are released in the game. And another thing is that if someone knows how to access songs video files that are yet to be in the game. 

Here's an example about I know about modding a song so far: [https://youtu.be/IfrqrrsD3gQ](https://youtu.be/IfrqrrsD3gQ)

So someone told me Gee, Bang Bang Bang, And Drinking Song is on the game's servers which he didn't want me to access so if you know how to access the servers of the game, you can just PM me.
