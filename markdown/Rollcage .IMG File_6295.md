- Post Title: Rollcage .IMG File

Hi,

First post here, so hello to everyone ! 

So, rollcage, I still love and play this game to this day, I would love it if someone could figure out how to extract the vehicles and track models and textures, etc  anything else would be a bonus, I have posted a link to the .IMG file that comes with the original installation disk, I assume ( since it is the biggest file at 78 Mb ) that this contains all the content I am looking for ?

Anyway, it would be really appreciated ! 

Rollcage .IMG file ( found within the installation file ).
