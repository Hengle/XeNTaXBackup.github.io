- Post Title: Dark Souls .ccm font edit

Looking for a way to edit Dark Souls prepare to Die .ccm font file
it is in .dcx format actually, but it can be uncompressed to .ccm using BinderTool or DeS-BNDBuild.exe
But I cannot edit the .ccm it self

Here is samples for the english and korean .ccm font files

Alright, the textures is packed inside .tpf files... Can be unpacked with binderTool

It is for dark souls 1
That is a good news, I will provide the .ttf later, but for now... can I know how would you do it?

I was thinking of adding new textures the with Arabic glyphs created by BMfont, then linking Korean characters to them,
So for example when writing letter "A" in Korean it will write the first arabic letter in the alphabet...
Same approach as ROM hacking approach.

So not really full native support of the language, but I'm fine with that.

Hi, did you extracted the textures from xbox .tpf files? 
If yes, what tool are you using to this? I tried BinderTool, but it only works for PC files...
Thanks!

Edit: I extracted the textures of the .tpf file using Noesis and a python plugin. My post is here: [https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php? ... 09#p135509](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=17308&p=135509#p135509)
