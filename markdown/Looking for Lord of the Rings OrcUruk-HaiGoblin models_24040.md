- Post Title: Looking for Lord of the Rings Orc/Uruk-Hai/Goblin models

Hey guys, 

I've been looking around for days now for LOTR Orcs, Goblin and Uruk-Hai. Sketchfab doesn't have a great selection (or even LOTR-like) of models, and my ripping attempts have been complete fails. Has anyone by chance ripped any Orcs/Uruk-Hai from games such as LOTR: Conquest, War in the North etc? If so, would you mind sending them to me via PM.

I'm working on a non-commercial project - a personal project mostly. I'd love to have access to proper LOTR Orcs for this.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
