hi all
i know the game is old but i somehow like the phrases the units say, the foreign ones.
now i got the modding suit the ess converters but i can't find the file containing the units' sounds are they in ZZ_win.dat, in .mpk files? if so how to unpack this extension?

well considering the fact that 90% of the game is the DATA folder itself, I'm sending the whole game.

well sorry, .that was the only direct high-speed DL link.
there's 5gb of data and i don't know which file contains sounds. my upload speed sucks. i can't upload this much data.i know that's the rule but please consider other people's situations as well. and here is a modding forum, not a download center. no one except modders will look around here.

I can't do anything about that download link, but I have done some research and I found very similar topic
[https://steamcommunity.com/app/21970/di ... 975245610/](https://steamcommunity.com/app/21970/discussions/0/611703999975245610/)
It appears that sounds are somewhere in those archives. You need to do more searching.

It's also good to link some other R.U.S.E modding related sites as it may help you in some way:
