- Post Title: Driver San Francisco Convert X360

Hello all,

I wanna ask for help. I have subtitles.astd file translated to my language from PC but i would like to play it on my x360, however that X360 version is byte reversed (BigEndian) and game is crashing if i use it directly from PC  . Can anyone do me favour, have a look and try to revers the PC vesion to X360? I would be more than greatfull  
All needed files are in the archive is below.

Or might someone made a repacker for subtitles.astd, so it also could do it fior X360 please ?

Thank you in advance
