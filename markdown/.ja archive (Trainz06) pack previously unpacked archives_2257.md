- Post Title: .ja archive (Trainz06) pack previously unpacked archives

I already added a post in the "completed" section but may get wider exposure here. Following your rules:

1) I'm looking for a plug-in to create .ja archives for Trainz06 using the same algorithm as the originals do.

2) the smallest archive is about 9MB and since the file structure is known an attachment may be redundant. (VB code in the other thread)
(I'm happy to provide the .ja if required)

3) demo -> [http://www.fileshack.com/file.x?fid=8144](http://www.fileshack.com/file.x?fid=8144)

4) a MultiExComm. plug-in [TrainDriver2005.dll] exist to unpack .ja archives (same structure as Trainz06) and works flawlessly. 
The original subject was discussed here -> [viewtopic.php?p=18643#18643](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=18643#18643)

Thanks - have fun - Marl
