I tried this weapon model with hex2obj, but I got superfluous faces:


3D Object Converter already supports Delta Force: Land Warrior, while FwO's 3DI file viewer supports Delta Force 1/2.

I tried the 3D Object Converter and Ultimate Unwrap 3D (costs money) for Delta Force 1 and 2 (by NovaLogic) but character models are messed up. Does anyone have an idea where I could find a working plugin for all Delta Force games again?
