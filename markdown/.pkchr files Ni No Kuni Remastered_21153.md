Hi,I was wondering if anyone can help me to extract the model data from Ni No Kuni Remastered,I know the game had an hard problem in the past due to a weird PS3 compression,I don’t know if the remastered on PC suffer from the same problem but at least the files can be easily found in the steam folder,the character folder has the .pkchr files,I don’t know if there is a tool for those..that’s why i’m asking here for help
