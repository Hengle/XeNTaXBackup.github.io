Guys, im completely useless.
I don't know the first thing about extracting from games to put them into 3d software or anything, but im extremely willing to learn; I really want to get some models to study/learn from them in order to improve the creation of my own models and such (also because i simply like some).

You all seem like wizards to me, and would absolutely love some insight on how I could begin the process of extracting from games (Im trying to extract from a PSvita game Genkai Tokki Seven Pirates first; their models are gorgeous! But im mainly after pc games) in some sort of list so i can kind of see what to learn bit by bit, like;

-making cereal-
-Grab a bowl, semi-sphericle ones are really good (I'd go off and learn what a bowl is)
-Get some milk and a box of cereal and a spoon (Look off and find how to get 'milk, cereal' and 'spoon')
-Pour the cereal into the bowl then the milk after; this will make the milk sink to the bottom and cover a bit of the cereal.
-Using the spoon, you will push the cereal into the milk then apply sugar ontop using the same spoon
-Eat fast before it gets soggy

Sort of thing

(although this sounds a bit like spoonfeeding..)

I think I need some knowledge on scripting, or something aswell for different file types?

I appreciate all responses and apologize for sounding a bit 'off' or anything. 
I want to wear a grand wizard robe too
Thanks!
