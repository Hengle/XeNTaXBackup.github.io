In 1989, Rolf Greven (Mr.Ammo) and I started XeNTaX as a graphics/demo group on the Commodore 64. 
See our first release here: [http://csdb.dk/release/?id=85097](http://csdb.dk/release/?id=85097)

To celebrate this 25 years of XeNTaX we will do various fun things. The first is the free registration as a forum member for an indefinite period of time. How about that? Next up will be free download of MultiEx Commander. Hold your breath for that one. 

So what about the old days when XeNTaX started?
This was in a time when we had just been fiddling around as the Unidentified Software Busters (AKA Bastards). 
Before that I had set up IKKE Productions on the MSX computers. 

However, we thought it time to be more productive and join the scene properly with a new group, so XeNTaX was born. I remember we made a list of possible names for this new group at my parents' home late at night, and then selected this one. 
It was also right there from the start the abbreviation would be XNTX. Hence, it being written as XeNTaX. On disk releases, files would have the abbreviation of the scene group responsible for the release next to the filename as such: 

```
TOXIC WASTE/XNTX
```
 
This way anyone could see who had made which file or release. Compare with FLT (Fairlight) and HTL (Hotline). 

After an active time in the C64 scene, especially as a music group in the period 1991-1993, [http://csdb.dk/group/?id=935](http://csdb.dk/group/?id=935) , we went off to other places, as high school had ended and I moved to study at the university. We did release some music for the Commodore Amiga, but XeNTaX started to compose music for PC and more serious programming. 

In 1997, MultiEx Commander was born, after a bunch of other stuff for fun, some of which can still be found here: [http://www.xentax.com/?page_id=114](http://www.xentax.com/?page_id=114) . I created it first for DOS, in Turbo C and Assembly. Check out the vid of it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rLlX9bQ8H4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rLlX9bQ8H4)

Later on, I created the first Windows version (3.0) in 2001: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mydmznJpCWU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mydmznJpCWU) 
MultiEx Commander was received well over the years by the press, of which some articles you can find here: [http://www.xentax.com/?page_id=183](http://www.xentax.com/?page_id=183) 

Version 3.1 had background music by me, but 3.2 was a better version in terms of layout and had music done my C64 scene connections Drax, Jeroen Tel, Laxity and The Gee, as well as XeNTaX member Aymes. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNB3_z6FCFE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNB3_z6FCFE)

In 2003, I began the Game Research Forum, first as a ways to help out users of MultiEx Commander to add new game resource archive file formats (I named "GRAF"), but then more and more as a true dedicated Game File Format Analysis forum. With friends like Watto of Game Extractor and Elbereth of Dragon Unpacker we then improved on my OpenGRAF website (a website I started to document known GRAF specifications) and build the XeNTaX WIKI (Game File Format Central) [http://wiki.xentax.com](http://wiki.xentax.com) 

We then put a lot of effort in the Game Research Forum, working on an ever increasing number of requests from guests and more people joined that also started to do a lot of researching over the years. Great people, all of them!  

For a decade the forum was completely free and it was only when costs started to become an issue, when we asked for donations. Due to the nature of the research, it is difficult to find proper funding as we have seen recently (but has been going on for a number of years now, several legal threats). It also has resulted in more strict rules. Nevertheless, everything is still possible here, and we have moved away from those sources of possible funding that are unfair or downright corrupted in their policy (e.g. Adsense and PayPal). 

But forget about that last part! Let's celebrate ! At least we do!

I've only been here since 2006, I might not be much of a ripper or a hex wizard like a lot of you guys, but being able to extract things from various games over the years really gave me a solid understanding of how 3D Game development works, and, as a 3D Artist I got to learn a lot of new techniques that I'd not have otherwise ever known.

So Thankyou Xentax!

I think we should all abandon file format research and go back to making C64 demos. It will be of greater benefit to humanity.

Actually, I've never released a single bit of C64 software, despite having written a generic 6502 CPU emulator some years (decades maybe now) ago and spent time doing random C64 graphics demos around the same time. I should probably right the wrong. I just don't have the actual hardware around to test on now, and only testing on an emulator seems blasphemous.

Thanks for the release, guys! I remember coming here back when I played Just Cause 1 to develop a music ripper, but I never got far... Not much history for me as compared to everyone else, but I appreciate the free download! Hopefully in the future I'll be able to contribute to game file research.

EDIT: The message "A download link was send to the email address you specified. Friend mailed! " appears although no email arrives - is it necessary for the hamsters to warm up before dispatching the email?

Downloaded and tried to enter code that was given to me but it doesn't work.
It says it needs a "valid donation code" to work.

I followed the link to the download.

Am I missing something else for the free anniversary edition?

Okay, let's see if we can fix that. What name and emailaddress did you use?

Contact me in PM to sort that out. 

Also I would like to hear of those who successfully installed it.

You'll probably get the missing control error on a 64-bit operating system - you need to get old of the .ocx, copy it into c:\windows\syswow64 and register it using regsvr32.

Excellent, thank you, that was the solution. I also had to make sure I was running command prompt as administrator before I did regsvr32.

Looks like I'm in the same boat as everyone else with the donation users error, so wait patiently I will. Again, thanks for the release Mr. Mouse!

Your game research forum is like nothing else on the web, I was very sad when I received the emails earlier this year about no more MultiEX and no more Game Research forum due to legal threats. Glad to see you have brought them back up though.    Hope the site continues for many more years!

It's good to see the site still around! I came/joined to read on GRAF (though I think I contributed to a couple minor bits on the wiki back when I had "free time") and still keep up now and again.

I'm always happy to see nice corners of the Internet stay alive and healthy.

Wow, who'd have guessed searching for a way to make music work in a Need for Speed game would lead to a tiny chunk of my childhood memories!

Hi all!
Long time lurker, first time poster - I signed up on Xentax a few days ago but NEVER realised the historic link till much later, Story Time!!

Back in the early 90s In my country there was no concept of a game being legal or pirated, we just got whatever we got, we still paid money and that's how it was for years till the internet made the world a smaller place and we started learning of how things were done elsewhere! Back then the machine that enamored me the most as an 8 year old, was a Commodore 64. It was great! However anyone who owned a PC (of any kind , whether 80x86 based or c64 or amiga etc) would always wonder why the following companies were the only ones who made games for it: Razor1911, FairLighT, Groo, IKARI+TALENT (and a few others I can't remember) and the most prevalent one: BASH Presents (or maybe just BASH).  It never occurred to me or my schoolfriends that these were cracking/reverse engineering groups - we actually thought they were the company creating and releasing the game! 

As we grew a little older we'd always discuss why these companies "didn't make the games as good as their introduction screens with all the fancy effects and text".  or "How is it that these companies can pay so much attention to detail inside the game but the pretty intros have English written by a 5 yr old?" or "I just wish we didn't have to watch so many intro screens before actually playing the game!" 

One Game however stood out especially on the C64, that one was Turbo Outrun - its the one we all agreed on that actually looked as good as the intro screen and played just as well ! I got my copy of the game on floppy and for a Good 8 years at least, XentaX were the people who made the game! Why? Because when I'd run the game the first screen I'd get was a Turbo Outrun one but with the trademark weird English with a message and 'Greetz' and then it'd end with Xentax by Mr. Mouse. When you pressed space you'd get ANTOHER message with PRESENTED TO YOU BY XENTAX followed by a message that "Gordon/Gambino/Gambit (I dont remember!) was a fool". Then I'd hit Enter and the game's proper intro with run! 

Now...DECADES later I'm searching for a way to figure out why ea3layer.exe is making corrupt mp3 files for Need For Speed Most wanted 2012 and I land upon this forum, I look at the banner that says 1989 and notice a post by "Mr. Mouse"... SUDDENLY it hits me "No way... they CANT be the same people!" LOTS of googling later and I'm reliving my past glory days EXACTLY like I remember them! Sure enough the SAME group and the same people behind said group! So Thank you for being around Xentax ... and especially thank you for "making" Turbo Outrun for the C64  

 Here's to another 25 years and beyond!

I don't understand, I wasn't a forum member before or what is it?

This is a good question... I think I've been a member for awhile, was registration disabled?

I registered only recently, and it cost 20 dollars to register. (via paypal). So seems now it will be free. As usual my timing is off. 

But thanks for the History lesson, I had no idea Xentax had such a long and interesting past. Happy 25th Anniversary!

Hi all!
Long time lurker, first time poster - I signed up on Xentax a few days ago but NEVER realised the historic link till much later, Story Time!!

Back in the early 90s In my country there was no concept of a game being legal or pirated, we just got whatever we got, we still paid money and that's how it was for years till the internet made the world a smaller place and we started learning of how things were done elsewhere! Back then the machine that enamored me the most as an 8 year old, was a Commodore 64. It was great! However anyone who owned a PC (of any kind , whether 80x86 based or c64 or amiga etc) would always wonder why the following companies were the only ones who made games for it: Razor1911, FairLighT, Groo, IKARI+TALENT (and a few others I can't remember) and the most prevalent one: BASH Presents (or maybe just BASH).  It never occurred to me or my schoolfriends that these were cracking/reverse engineering groups - we actually thought they were the company creating and releasing the game! 

As we grew a little older we'd always discuss why these companies "didn't make the games as good as their introduction screens with all the fancy effects and text".  or "How is it that these companies can pay so much attention to detail inside the game but the pretty intros have English written by a 5 yr old?" or "I just wish we didn't have to watch so many intro screens before actually playing the game!" 

One Game however stood out especially on the C64, that one was Turbo Outrun - its the one we all agreed on that actually looked as good as the intro screen and played just as well ! I got my copy of the game on floppy and for a Good 8 years at least, XentaX were the people who made the game! Why? Because when I'd run the game the first screen I'd get was a Turbo Outrun one but with the trademark weird English with a message and 'Greetz' and then it'd end with Xentax by Mr. Mouse. When you pressed space you'd get ANTOHER message with PRESENTED TO YOU BY XENTAX followed by a message that "Gordon/Gambino/Gambit (I dont remember!) was a fool". Then I'd hit Enter and the game's proper intro with run! 

Now...DECADES later I'm searching for a way to figure out why ea3layer.exe is making corrupt mp3 files for Need For Speed Most wanted 2012 and I land upon this forum, I look at the banner that says 1989 and notice a post by "Mr. Mouse"...

 Here's to another 25 years and beyond!

I've got a similar background of playing on the C64, pirate cassette collections and the fascination with cracktros.  Although, I've never encountered XeNTaX back in the day so I had no idea about their background. I've lurked on this forum for a while, first time poster. Just wanted to congratulate everyone on the anniversary.

Btw, I suppose this is the message you mentioned, right?

Haha that is GREAT! So many years ago and you still remember that. 

BTW MultiEx Commander download should work now and MultiEx Commander should also run. Sorry about the bug earlier. . .

@qutulu 
> Btw, I suppose this is the message you mentioned, right?
Yessir! Thats the one! 

@Mr.Mouse Finally! After 20 years I get to 'meet' the man who "made" one of my all time favorite games and made me listen to the first tune that got me into video game music. Because he made me listen to it TWICE before I could start the game! 

I can finally ask you questions like: "why didn't you make Jereon Tel, who clearly was part of your company called XentaX, put the theme song in the game itself?? or "Why doesn't Sega / US Gold put messages in their console games like on the C64?? What if Gambit made games on consoles and I'd bought it by mistake! Who'd want to buy from a fool??"** etc. 

I even remember when we'd make up "facts" at school : "like you know that werewolf game on the NES is based on an actual story??" or  "You know Xentax is Sega's European division, right?  This is probably how Europeans roam around all day: in their Ferraris and mini dress wearing babes!"

Being 8~10 was so fun...and insanely inaccurate. 


** I know the reasons NOW, but back then these were valid questions dammit!

Hehe Just to be on the safe side here, but you do know now that XeNTaX did not make the Turbo Outrun game, right? 

I guess it must have looked like to an 8 year old that there were a lot of intro's before you could even start the game (but that were actually intro's written by crackers to show off their group and that they managed to crack that particular game).   

What country is that, by the way? As for the screen, that is from a demo, and I do not remember putting it in front of the game itself (I may have, but then that is lost in memory). If you would have the original file you refer to, I'd like to get it as well.

I feel really stupid but I just can't get past the Captcha. Regardless of whether I try the audio or visual versions, it never accepts what I type in.


** EDIT **

It appears that FireFox hates the Captcha. Everything worked in IE.

Thanks Mr. Mouse.

Haha this is exactly what it was! The city/country I was in at the time (Dubai, U.A.E) wasn't even considered an option to sell games in by the actual publishers. Every game in the shops, no matter what the medium be it cartridge or floppy, was pirated. And I totally understand if you didn't add this to a game - almost everyone I've talked to from the C64 scene don't know of "BASH" for example, yet I messaged a childhood friend after years and he totally remembers their intro before you could run the game itself! Since piracy was huge there (and to be honest, it's STILL huge where I am now - hello from Sri Lanka btw!)  I assumed these shopkeepers just took appropriate intros from wherever they could find them and then slap them onto cracked games and sold them. They pirated from the pirates (and the demo scene) ! 

From a marketing point of view it worked well since a LOT of demos/intros would be put up on display to sell computers (this, for example, is how I was introduced to the Unreal demo by FutureCrew and Crystal Dreams II by Triton..they were played on a, at that time, amazingly fast 486 DX2-66Mhz - which was placed in showcase windows so passerby's could see it!  

> If you would have the original file you refer to, I'd like to get it as well.
Sadly I no longer have any of my original floppies or the C64 anymore either since I've shifted countries. 

> Hehe Just to be on the safe side here, but you do know now that XeNTaX did not make the Turbo Outrun game, right?
Yes this sad reality dawned on me much later!  I'm sure 8 yr old me would've been ready with a 'fact' like: "...and so after the success of Turbo Outrun XeNTaX released Test Drive and the Need for Speed series and went onto become EA Blackbox Canada" but then history has proven me wrong! 

> Speaking of which, I dont want to derail the topic, but i'd like to ask help on how to encode mp3s into NFS: Most Wanted's (2012) format, where would be the best place to ask that in the forum?  I read the rules again but wasn't sure. Cheers again!
edit: Disregard the above I found the exact subsection I needed, Thanks again !

Tried with my one email address, timed out halfway through the download and link stopped working. Tried with my other email address, got to 99% timed out at the link does not work anymore. This is ridiculous, should I now try with a third address?

EDIT: tried third address, figured it out, first time because of my bad internet the download manager basically ran out of retries because of timeouts, the second time the AV kept blocking the web address at 99% and the retries ran out because of timeouts. This time I downloaded it via browser and had to disable AV, strangely enough the actual setup file does not bother the AV one bit so it must be the way downloads are scripted from your website.

Congrats on 25 years... wow!

I started out on a C=64 with a track and sector editor to fool around with games and also a program that had to create an "error" on a certain track of the floppy in order to fool the copy of the game into running. Ah, those were the days. 

Anyway...

I went to the link provided and entered my Email address for the free download of MultiEX, but every time I start the download it pops up a requester saying that the file is not accessible, etc. I have wasted 3 of my 5 tries now.

Congrats on the XeNTaX 25th Anniversary!  Shocked at how it's older than me too LOL Thanks for letting us download it and all 

I've downloaded it but, I have encountered a problem, when launching it, at least after I've entered my email address and the registered code. 

Hope there'll be a solution here! X_X Thanks in advance!

I guess I'm the only one in the Universe that can't get the link in the Email to work properly.

I tried it in Firefox yesterday (3x) and every time it said the file was not accessible.

I just tried it in I.E. and the first thing it did was said the file couldn't be downloaded. Then I clicked retry and it started to get the file and then said the download was interrupted. I clicked resume and it said the download was complete. I looked in the dir I saved it in and it's 0 bytes. WTF?

Also, this thread is not really to discuss MultiEx Commander issues, there is a forum for that, that one might want to read first.

I registered... wow 3 years ago, didn't pay anything. Not even asked for a donation iirc. Not much changed since 2011 I see.

Never heard of multiex commander, seems like.... eh.... bizarre thing this... eh... is it useful? Some reverse engineering tool that is...
