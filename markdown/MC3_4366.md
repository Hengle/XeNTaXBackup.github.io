Good day everyone. A reason of my posting here is to ask if anyone knows what to do with MC3 sound files. I`ve seen some specs on HCS64.com but my MC3s are not kind of ADPCM like it`s said there! If I open it as an interleaved ADPCM/PCM I hear nothing even close to music, just some beeping or noise.
This is [a sample](http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7SLIZFSI) if anyone interested in it
Goodbye!

Just looking at the nibble distributions I agree that it isn't ADPCM, wonder what it could be?

In spite of the fact that these MC3s don`t have ADPCM nature they were all situated inside a bigfile with extension MPK just like it was written in your specs for Terminator - Redemption and Mission impossible

These MC3 files are indeed ADPCM (3-bit). I've written a decoder.
Mono & stereo files only. If multichannel MC3 exists, notify me.
Checked with: 
MX Rider
Spy Hunter
Mission: Impossible â€“ Operation Surma
Terminator 3: The Redemption

Hi Daemon1, thanks for coding this tool and testing it on numerous titles! I'm really grateful to you for all your work because MX Rider is PS2 exclusive and that's why there're no workarounds like ripping this VG versions for other consoles (& Spy hunter (2001/2003) is also a nasty troublemaker as it uses MC3s not only on Playstation Two but also on Xbox; previously in-convertible tracks in MC3 format appear even in later PC port of the same game!) however I have some bugs to report. Commentator files in MX Rider for some reason decode with quite a few flaws: not only resulting WAVs sound slowed down like if they should be in stereo instead of mono (or have much higher sample rate) but there's also noticeable distortion in the background (like if interleave in Sony ADPCM tracks was set wrong). [Here](https://mega.nz/#!1Y9lWJJD!yQjyQKzBx50-AgBQoHUEN1ERcY3wSFp8c8krTc4H_xE)'re some tiny samples for you to check them out.
Thnx in advance as your help here is truly needed! Best regards!
Edit: it seems to be the same problem with all voice quotes in 3 platforms of SH too as computers, PS2 & XB use identical MC3s (well 80/90 are bytewise identical on all three platforms but there're ten exclusives on each of them).
