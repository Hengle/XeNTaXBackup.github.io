- Post Title: HAWX 2

Is anyone interested in decoding the HAWX2 model format?
Here is a link to download some sample files: [http://www.filedropper.com/sukhoipakfa](http://www.filedropper.com/sukhoipakfa)
The HAWX2 .pak files can be extracted using the case-sensative password: pF5hfGe2TfrbGe8IzaRtXsIm
The models appear to use the extensions .bing, .anims, and .pmem. The game uses .dds files for textures just like the first HAWX game.
