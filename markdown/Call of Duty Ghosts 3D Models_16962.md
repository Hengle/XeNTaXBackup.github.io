I am trying to use Lime64 and i have the latest steam version of the game and unfortunately lime64 does not extract the models, i am currently trying to extract the space scenarios in the game but only to fail at doing so, this is the result i currently get.
Please can anyone help me? i really need this done, thanks!

 I  also added the obj option on the options list.

Does greyhound work on Black Ops II Plutonium? Tried to rip Michael Madsen from Mob of the Dead but it doesn't hook into plutonium and I don't own the game on Steam :/
