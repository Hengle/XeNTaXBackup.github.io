Sorry for bothering, but where/how did you get the textures?

There is a tool by shadowmoy here: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6373](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6373) You can use it to extract the textures.

Hello! I really appreciate that you made this tool, it's a shame that Bleach SR doesn't get much love to begin with so it's amazing that you made it   

My question is, would you be willing to slightly expand the tool a bit? It would make work-flow much more efficient if there was a way to batch export all the animations of the loaded SPK, as well as export them with their original animations names (I'm not the best when it comes to the technicals of file reading but I was able to load/export the animation names alone from the SPKs with my own script, tho they are in a different order than what's displayed in your tool).

Any assistance with this would be much appreciated!
