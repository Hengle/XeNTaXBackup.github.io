- Post Title: MotoGP 3 URT by THQ .ark file support

Could you please add support for the .ark files found in MotoGP 3 URT by THQ?

I have attached a sample file from the game.

Here is the playable demo link:

Thank you very much!

Sorry for the noob question, but what is GAUP?

I have MultiEX Commander (registered) and it doesn't recognize the .ark files.
