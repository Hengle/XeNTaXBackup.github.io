- Post Title: Space Channel 5 part 2 (PC) Movement

Hello! I'm trying to modify a Dreamcast game called Space Channel 5 (this is part 2 and the steam version) so that someone I know can make a kaizo mod, with modified input and timings.
I have gone through the files for the last 3 or so days to see if I could find anything. I have a few potential leads for files, but this might be something in the code itself, so I think this is a good place to ask. Does anyone know anything about the contents of the code of SC5? Is there a decompilation out there, or a way for me to do it myself? Thanks in advance!

I have obtained a complete decompilation of the game, and it's written in C, apparently. Is there a tool out there to go through the hundreds of files and maybe see what things do what? There are also miscellaneous .DIS and .ASM files. I'm currently working on learning C# also, so is it possible to read C with any level of understanding if you know C?
