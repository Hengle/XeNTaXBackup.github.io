Hi, I extracted one of the .rsf archives and got quite a few different formats out of it. I don't even know where to start (i'm assuming the .moe file under GEOM but i'm not sure), and if we can copy the UV mapping that would be nice as well.

That's awesome! looks great. the only other thing i was going to ask is if we could somhow pull the material mapping from the .lta file (if that's not possible, it should still be possible to work with this). Is there potentially a header separating the submeshes? I saw your test for extracting madden 12 and saw the header STRM but i found no such header in my .rsf or in the .moe

(Should also be possible to get values of "specularIntensity" for example, if you are a coder.)

I saw your test for extracting madden 12 and saw the header STRM but i found no such header in my .rsf or in the .moedunno, what you searched for, but the params are simply to be found (using "MRTS" and "XDNI" for search of further sub meshes):

accompanied by the strings "MRTS" (-> "STRM") and "XDNI", the latter reads "INDX" backwards.
