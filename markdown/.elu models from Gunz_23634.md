- Post Title: .elu models from Gunz

Hello! I was using a blender script of version 2.49b and also another for blender 2.63a from here ([http://forum.ragezone.com/f245/elu-ani- ... ost4297496](http://forum.ragezone.com/f245/elu-ani-blender-importer-488857/#post4297496)) and it should load the bones and  everything but in my case only load in some models, anothers models just popup an script error and I'm not using a newer version of files, and in other cases just doesn't show anything (model or error). Maybe someone with more knowledge about this can take a look at the script, I was trying to remove some functions that could be causing the error but still have many errors in console. I'm gonna add some sample files, if someone can take a look on this thanks in advance.

In my opinion you should ask directly on that forum and/or to the owner of the script.

p.s: for next posts please submit a valid error message , posting screenshot or debug messages so that people could directly understand what the problem is

Me, I never understood python problems directly.  

there's two caveats, no 1: version 0 is not supported
supported versions: ELU_VERSIONS = (0x5004, 0x5005, 0x5006, 0x5007)

no 2 (Blender 2.63a+): problem when generating texture path
fix by expanding this line if len(fpaths) > 0: 
like so
if len(fpaths) > 0 and len(fnames) != 1 :

(in Blender 2.49b only the face loaded)

Placing a debug print line (just before that line) to print out the values of variables/strings will give you more insight into the problem(s).

You will need to read here: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html) 
and understand "tuples" or you won't get far, btw.

eyy Shakotay! How hard would be change the version of that weapon to suit to one that can be openable in blender, because I just found that, that weapon was like a mod not a official weapon, but the game read it without problems. I was checking the header and it changed a bit, but it seems not like another version, seems that they added some data to not be openable with the script, or well just my tought. Here is one official item of the game.

I wouldn't waste my time with modded items that don't follow the format (even if they are loaded by the game; maybe it crashes after your 100th savegame or so because of a faulty modded item).

In that you are right Shakotay, I also tried to extract the model with the hex2obj but so far I have only been able to obtain vertices xD. I'm gonna try again after work. Thanks Shako!
