- Post Title: Possible Granny2 Animations ?

I need help to understand if these file in attachments can be a granny animation data.
I found this string at the end of each .anim file with a Hex editor :
"....3D Studio MAX Granny Standard Exporter, SDK version 2.6.0.9..."

i know how use the dll for 3dstudio plugin and i already made a little plugin written in c# to decompress Medieval2TotalWall pack (LZO compression algorithm), i found this site to understand how use granny2.dll
[http://s3pi-wrappers.googlecode.com/svn ... nny2/IO.cs](http://s3pi-wrappers.googlecode.com/svn/!svn/bc/66/trunk/RigResource/Granny2/IO.cs)

Someone help me to understand what file it is ?I certainly know that other data : 3D model, textures, etc ... are present in other files whose format is known.

They are animations exported with Granny.
But as the Granny system is highly modable, they are not standard Granny files.
I'm still looking at them.

Thank you very much for your interest, unfortunately I have trouble understand it, I can only tell you that the game's producers have tried to make the files as clear as possible ...

The problem is what i can't undertand there granny2 file start, the first byte are always the same for all game's file.

If you can understand something let me know immediately
