- Post Title: ATOM RPG Save Editor

Haye, I'm back with a new ugly thingy.

ATOM RPG is a russian crowdfunded survival post-apoc. game (and it's also quite fun, reminding the FO1 and FO2 style).
I decided to experiment with a few things with the game and therefore made this save editor.
It works but you might have some problems, I made it for who has more time and interest than me.

If your plan is to edit your characters' skills, then it's working fine, otherwise you need to put your hands in the code and the game itself.

Have fun with it!
