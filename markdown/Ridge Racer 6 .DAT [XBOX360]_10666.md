- Post Title: Ridge Racer 6 .DAT [XBOX360]

Hi, i would like to have an assist on researching this game's file. I have split 3 files with the same format in 10 mb part. I guess this file contains the files that i want. Would be appreciated if someone take a peek on it since i'm no good at this. If the files are violating rules.

Example files :

Edit: incase of questions popping up, i wanted to get car geometries and textures.
