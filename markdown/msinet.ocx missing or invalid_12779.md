- Post Title: msinet.ocx missing or invalid

I was sent the download link today and installed it on 64-bit windows 7. When I run the program I get:

Run-time error '339'

Componenet 'msinet.ocx' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid

The file is there. I also tried downloading a vb6 service pack and installing the ocx file that it contains (I don't have visual basic). That made no difference. I also tried swapping that ocx file and the one that comes with multiex and rebooting. And no difference.

Do you know what I should do?

Did you try to run it as administrator?

Uggh..... sorry for wasting people's time. Right in the readme file:

"Important note: You must at all times run MultiEx Commander as administrator. Make sure you set this in the short-cut accordingly."

Yes, it works running as administrator.
