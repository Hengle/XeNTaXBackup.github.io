You can use this script [https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/red_d ... on_rsc.bms](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/red_dead_redemption_rsc.bms)
with quickbms [https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)
to extract data.

By extracting it, can I save it as .xst again?

To save it as XST you could try to use reimport mode 
which is described here [http://aluigi.zenhax.com/papers/quickbms.txt](http://aluigi.zenhax.com/papers/quickbms.txt)

Thanks for your help!
I unpacked all the .xst data, but looks like they're not fully decrypted, I tried to open it with sublime, notepad and Hex Editor, dunno if there's a specific program to edit the decompressed files, something like GXT Editor for gta IV.

You can edit texts in hex editor. If you open one of the decompressed "en" files and scroll down a little you will see english text [https://i.imgur.com/OdH7INx.png](https://i.imgur.com/OdH7INx.png)

Thanks a lot!
I thought that at the beginning of the file the texts in english were encrypted

Can you still make polish subtitles? I really want to play this game in my language.

I have never planned to create any polish translation for this game, sorry.
