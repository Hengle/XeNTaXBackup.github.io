As you may have noticed, each topic has it's own Like button for Facebook, so you can share a topic if you want. However, do you see it localized? Or in English, or in a language not your own?

It's non-English, but I am in the USA, so the language isn't localized correctly.

I really don't know Dutch, just German, but I am pretty sure that Dutch is what it is.
