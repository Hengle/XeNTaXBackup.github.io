- Post Title: [PS1] Walt Disney World Quest - Magical Racing Tour (BIGFILE.DAT) by Crystal Dynamics

Hello. The main goal is to translate the game. But the fonts and loading screens are packaged in a BIGFILE.DAT file, in which the data is either compressed or encrypted. Only sounds remained in their original form (played in PSound). How can I unpack and pack BIGFILE?

The game was developed by Crystal Dynamics.
