Hey Everyone!

this game uses a similar format to the red faction series that volition has made but unfortunately the tools for that game don't work on the files for this one :\
turns out someone did make a plugin for game extractor to view content in the files but they come in a multitude of formats, (ceg,vf2,btz) so i was hoping someone could take a gander at the one i uploaded v to see if they're accessible or not, Thanks!

I didn't check for datablocks between the textures.

i see. the other archives themselves seem pretty small in files size; not sure if they'd all be textures or not
