- Post Title: How to import .dff Alicia Online files to 3ds max?

Hello everyone!

I tried to import Alicia's .dff files using mariokart64n's max script and different .dff import/export plugins, but none of this worked...
Can anyone help me with this? Thanks in advance.

p.s. sorry for bad English т.т
