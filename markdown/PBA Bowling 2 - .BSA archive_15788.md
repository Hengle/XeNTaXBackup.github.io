- Post Title: PBA Bowling 2 - .BSA archive

Sorry I don't know where else to post this so I thought I would do it here since you guys seem to know a whole lot. As many of you know I am a huge bowling video game fan. I am trying to re-skin PBA Bowling 2 for windows XP. This game was made by Bethesda and all of the data files are in.BSA format. I googled that format and found a utility that was used for later games released by the software company called the bethesda Software extractor but it only works with newer games and not one that is this old. This game came out in 1999 I believe. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot
