- Post Title: [Switch] Trine 5 .fbq

Hello! I need help unpacking and repack one of the .fbq files from the Switch version of the game.
I don't know what compression method is used. Tried this old script from Aluigi - [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/trine2.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/trine2.bms) but no luck.
Attached the .fbq file:

Don't know, file "grand.bin" compressed or not, but other files processed good.
