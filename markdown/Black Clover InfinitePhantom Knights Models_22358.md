- Post Title: Black Clover: Infinite/Phantom Knights Models

Hey there all!

After trying lots of things and looking a bit around, I come here for help regarding the models of this Black Clover mobile game.
I tried to look into the files by extracting an Android apk and tried multiple tools on my own without success. 
I extracted this out (In in the ModelData folder if I remember correctly) [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... 1_0000.pck](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/552325618264702978/687681290916724816/MP_0001_0000.pck) but got stuck afterwards.
A friend tried to make sense of the file format and got the mesh out, but couldn't get textures. [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/552325618264702978/687864650326737057/unknown.png)

Here are some notes he made: [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... /notes.txt](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/552325618264702978/687875401082863616/notes.txt)
And here's another file: [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... 1_0000.txp](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/552325618264702978/687875838925996063/MP_0001_0000.txp)

So, anybody willing to help out with this? You'd have my eternal gratitude^^

This game is created with the same engine as Valkyrie Anatomia.
The txp file has not been reversed.

You can use the attached bms script to unpack the pck files. Then use this tool with the Valkyrie Anatomia plugin for loading the mdl files : [viewtopic.php?t=19078](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=19078) Also has skeleton support.

Woah great thanks!
(Sorry for the delay in answering, couldn't get on a pc for some time^^)
How about the textures, do you have any idea how to get them?

Ps: The file I shared was from the apk itself, does anyone know how to get the others? There are only four models in the folder but there are a lot more that should be able to be available...

Nope. They are somehow compressed (maybe crunch) or some weird format. I didn't like the quality of the models, so didn't dig too deep into textures.

I'm also not the biggest fan of those models, but they are unfortunately the only ones available for some characters...(if you looked at the list I provided that is^^)
