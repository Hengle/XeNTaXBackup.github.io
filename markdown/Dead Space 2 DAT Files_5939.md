- Post Title: Dead Space 2 DAT Files

Hello to everybody and let me say that I'm quite surprised with this forum. Thanks to all enthusiasts who contribute here!
Now the deal. The Dead Space 2 game have been released a couple of days ago. I've looked into its structure in PC version and found that all game resources are wrapped into the .dat files. Just six big files named from DS2DAT0.DAT to DS2DAT5.DAT and ranging from 624 MiB to 1.99 GiB. All of them have BIGH magic bytes at beggining and seems that files are not compressed, since they're can be packed quite nice. If you would like to dig it a little bit then you can download the first 10 MB from DS2DAT0.DAT file at the link above.
[DS2DAT0.7z](http://narod.ru/disk/4524763001/DS2DAT0.7z.html)
Just pass the captcha, press big green button and extract 7z archive.

Oh, I see. Well, that topic was named with spell errors so I didn't found it during search. Moderators, please feel free to remove my thread. Also it would be nice to correct that topic name.
Dead Spece -> Dead Space
