- Post Title: Help with unpacking .DAR/CDAR file

Hi, 

I'm trying to unpack this CDAR file: [https://mega.nz/file/Q94lBI5b#Xg-GNR5SF ... hsemoLHzvI](https://mega.nz/file/Q94lBI5b#Xg-GNR5SFqpRu4wZQGIWz7v-VjUHznoNlhsemoLHzvI)

I've tried a BMS script for it ([http://aluigi.org/bms/kiniro_no_corda.bms](http://aluigi.org/bms/kiniro_no_corda.bms)) but it's not working.
I tried to decompress using offzip, and I thought it worked but it gave me a bunch of .dat and .tm2 files that area around ~12kb each :c

Can please request some help with this one? 
Even a point to the right direction would be appreciated!
