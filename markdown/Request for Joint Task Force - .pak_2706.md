- Post Title: Request for Joint Task Force - .pak

Could you try and add support for Joint Task Force *.PAK archives?.  Here is a link to a demo of the game.

Also included the extracted first and last part of one of the archives which can be found here:

I believe john_doe has the answer for you, I guess he just never got round to making a plugin for MultiEx Commander.

Sorry, there's nothing usable yet. It's been on my todo-list since back then 
But I've located the decompression code, it's "just" a matter of writing the code

I appreciate you both looking into this.  I hope this means something may get done sooner, rather than later....

Any updates on this one yet john_doe?  Don't mean to be a pest, just didn't want this one to get lost in all the requests like the last thread on this game.
Thanks again
