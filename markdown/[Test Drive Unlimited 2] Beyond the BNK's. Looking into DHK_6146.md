- Post Title: [Test Drive Unlimited 2] Beyond the BNK's. Looking into DHK

There's a large thread about other things, but I wanted to be more specific here. 

Okay. . . I've extracted all the crap, but I'm looking into editing a car. I want to change the way it's handling. IE: top speed, acceleration, grip, suspension etc. From what I've learned in the other thread is that I'm gunna need to work with the DHK file, which to my knowledge is working with havok's physics. SO.... 

How do I go about editing the physics? Do I need to work with the DHK's? If so, how do I edit them? Is this even possible? I'm pretty sure it's a max thing, but I'm not entirely sure. I'd also like to know if there's any other way to do it. Also, back to the other thread quick.  .  . [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5747](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5747)  after editing, how do I repack the file back into the .BIG/.MAP?
