Go to its official website and download from fansite section. You cannot miss it.

  ignore that!

the link is to my script for quickbms - download that here: [http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)

copy the code from [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7518](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7518) into a text file and run quickbms with that file on the Art.bar

that should explain everything
