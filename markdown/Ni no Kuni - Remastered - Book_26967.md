- Post Title: Ni no Kuni - Remastered - Book

Good morning, good afternoon, good evening.

I am a big fan of the game Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch, and I would like to localize it into another language. However, my main obstacle in the game is the book that exists within it. It is an essential part of the story, and I don't want to leave it out.

Currently, there are tools available to extract the book from the PS3 version, but they don't work for the remastered version, causing some issues.

I will provide some links if anyone wants to help extract the images from the gvd.dat file:

An attempt I made to convert it to Python with AI.

Links to PC files for analysis.

Link I found about the gvd.dat file structure of the PS3 version.

I hope this helps, thanks.
