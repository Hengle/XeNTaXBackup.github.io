- Post Title: Character select images from Smackdown vs Raw 2010

I've already successfully replaced some models from previous games onto SvR2010. 
For now, I just wanted to replace their pictures on the character select screen. For the names I think I'll just dig the .pac files with HEX Workshop. 
But I don't have a clue of where to find/unpack the character select images.
