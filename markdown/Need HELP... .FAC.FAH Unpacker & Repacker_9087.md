- Post Title: Need HELP... .FAC/.FAH Unpacker & Repacker

Good Day!
I need help on Unpacking this kind of file; FAC & FAH.
If possible, a vice-versa Unpacker/Packer program or plugin. 
It's from the PSP game Sunday x Magazine Shuuketsu! Choujou Daikessen.
I need it to do a localization (translation) project.

Sample file link:

Thank you always.
