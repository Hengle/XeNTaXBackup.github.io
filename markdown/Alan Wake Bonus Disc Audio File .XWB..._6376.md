- Post Title: Alan Wake Bonus Disc Audio File .XWB...

Hello guys, i have extracted single files (video and pics) from Alan Wake Bonus disc.

Unfortunatley, audio file is compressed in .XWB. 
When i uncompressed it with "unxwb" i get 5 strange "wav" audio files.

If i import it on audacity like "raw", i just listen noise. 

How can i transform it in classic WAV or MP3 file? Thanks

depends by what has been reported by unxwb.
if you can't play them it's for sure the msadpcm codec or xma2 and I bet on the first.
vlc or mplayer can play the adpcm codecs perfectly while for xma/xma2 you need other solutions

upload one of the extracted files but nothing changes because my reply will be the same as before: vlc/mplayer for adpcm and xmadecode/towav/other_solutions for xma/xma2

I don't find "xmadecode.exe" on the net. How it works?

I've downloaded "tovaw.exe", but when i copy the audio file in "tovaw.exe" doesn't works.

Maybe it needs a header.

And how it works? I'm noob about that... 

If someone is expert about this file, can help me to convert just 5 audio files?

Sorry, I've been away from internet for the last week. But I'll download it and upload it probably tomorrow or the day after.
