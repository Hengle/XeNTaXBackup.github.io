- Post Title: Haunting Ground Bms Script

I really need help with writing it.
I tried to do it myself, but I guess I'm not experienced enough for that, because it didn't work out too well.   
So, I think I'd die out of happines if someone could write it for me or at least give me some advices.
//Yes, someone actually did write it and ripped all the models, but doesn't share and I got everything, just not the models and it's driving me nuts. 
I can provide any file you want (hope it doesn't violate the rules or anything).


Pretty please.
