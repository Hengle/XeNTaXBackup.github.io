- Post Title: Horde .VDO\.VDX[DOS]; .DUK[3DO]

This is a video formats, which uses old codecs or something.

DOS version use RATVID codec - header is same(RATVID). This codec, as I can understand, use compression for files.

3DO version uses old DUCK video format, which is Pre-TrueMotion. One video stored in 4 files with same names - .duk(video), .frm(frames), .hdr(header), .tbl(table). This format gives the best quality video than TrueMotion for Saturn and RATVID for DOS.

I try to use some tools for play .duk files - vlc, mplayer, ffmpeg, phantasmagoria 2 player, but without any results. I found here - [http://forum.uqm.stack.nl/index.php?topic=511.0](http://forum.uqm.stack.nl/index.php?topic=511.0) - about .duk Player for DOS also, but dont find on the net.

Looking a decoders of this formats.

Test files can be provided in PM or given a link in topic.
