- Post Title: NFS MW (2005) Xbox 360 texture extraction from STREAML2RA.BUN?

The STREAML2RA.BUN file is weirdly JDLZ packed in the Xbox 360 version, making texture tools like NFS-TexEd not able to read it. How would I go about decompressing at least the tpks properly? The furthest I've gotten was a chunk of the first texture coming out correct, with the rest of it being a garbled mess, with the others not loading, presumably due to them being in different JDLZ chunks? idk
