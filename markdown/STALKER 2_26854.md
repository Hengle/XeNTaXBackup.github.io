- Post Title: STALKER 2

Anyone did any research on STALKER 2 with the recent build that was published?
Textures appear to be virtual textures. Can use FModel to extract proper meshes with skeleton as long as you use the right mapping file which is on github.
If anyone did any research on textures please let me know. Also let me know if you need sample files.
