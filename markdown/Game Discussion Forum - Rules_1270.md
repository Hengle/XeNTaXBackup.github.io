- Post Title: Game Discussion Forum - Rules

Welcome to the Game Discussion Forum!

Here are the 7th of February 2021 updated rules for this forum, mostly things NOT to do (READ THEM ALL!):

In general, please bear in mind the following regulations that pertain to most commercial games (the "Application"), and which it NOT allowed on our forum:

1. Use the Application in connection with designing or assisting in the design of cheats, automation software, bots, hacks, mods or any other unauthorized third-party software.
2. License, sublicense, transfer, assign, reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, distribute or otherwise exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion of, use of or access to the Application.
3. Modify, adapt, make derivative works of, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of the Application.
4. Engage in any actions that provoke, encourage or abets any actions that lead to a violation of the Application's terms of use and the User Agreement.

If you engage in any of that, your account may be deleted/banned. 

Additional rules:

1. No paying for hacking. The stand is: do not ask to pay someone, nor ask to get paid.  
2. Do not publicly share any illegal content, the risk is yours. Not ours. But we will act against you if necessary. 
3. We are not a warez site. If you are a warez dude, then leave. Do not discuss cracks, hacks or whatever that is illegal. We don't want that here. 
4. Do not screw others.
5. Do not upload files that are the legal property of others.
6. Don't be a prick. Be nice to others.
7. No blatant porn, nudity or other unwanted adult spam. 
8. If you need help with something, ask nicely by posting a new topic in one of the appropriate forums. 
9. If you get help from someone, thank them. It won't kill you, and it is the civilized thing to do. 
10. Do not under any circumstances contact our senior members via PM for help with this or that. They don't care about your problem. If you need help with something, see rule 8. 
11. The language is English. So we can all understand each other. We come from all over the world, that's why we insist on English.  
12. No ripping of commercial 3D models, no asking for it, no discussing it. (e.g. Sketchfab)
13. No reverse engineering of commercial products to be discussed without permission of the copyright holders. Examples of copyright holders inlude, but are not limited to, Konami, Sony, Microsoft, Sketchfab, Nintendo and many more. See General rules above. 

Failure to comply with any of these will result in INSTANT BAN or deleted account. Be warned.

One more thing: if you have information which is generally useful for a topic, please post that information in the topic instead of PMing it to specific members. PMed information/answers don't help future readers who are looking for whatever answers your PMs contained.

In wake of recent events. I'd like to say that obsessive harassing of users on this forum publicly or via private messages is not allowed. If you require assistance please post a new forum thread. Messaging staff or members of the community about file formats will not get you answers quicker.

Don't reply to threads here asking for help, by telling the person to join the Discord (or any other website/service) for a tool or script or whatever; instead post a publicly-accessible link or a copy of the script, or directly include the relevant tool as an attachment to your post.
