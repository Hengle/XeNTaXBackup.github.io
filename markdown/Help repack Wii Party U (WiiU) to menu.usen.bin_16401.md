- Post Title: Help repack Wii Party U (WiiU) to menu.usen.bin

menuxx.bin can be extrated to .arc files.

but when  i reimport 30+ files into .bin files, i get a freezon.

i found it [https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=14084](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=14084) 

With Quickbms Reimport function, can not make the game 100% work properly

Is there a way to package Mario Party 10 / Wii Party U's .bin file?

I searched for a long time and did not find a tool

I am trying to translate the two games into Chinese, the current text is completed



Sent a modified picture with the font re-packet


Who can help create a script for import？
