- Post Title: Need help with understanding PSP VN scripts

Hey there, I recently got a PSP VN called Corpse Party and thought would be a cool stuff to learn Japanese too (OCR issues btw). I tried decrypting and extracting contents, and got SCRIPT files. But they are all jumbled, I could not find any pattern on where scripts start next, they all are divided into individual map scripts. I tried searching "SCRIPT" string in EBOOT.BIN and all (hey! It might be encryoted I don't know!) but there was nothing. So anyone has an idea on it? It would help me a bunch to go through it comfortably

EDIT:- Here is one of map SCRIPTs [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ym8me](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ym8me) ... h3X5I3WqKC
There is also some sort of MAP data associate with it in this file [https://drive.google.com/open?id=10pCfA](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10pCfA) ... Us7YWMfLuy I can't understand it, but I assume it has to do with boundaries, or maybe also on triggers?

Also, I remember seeing "source/VisualNovelEngine" or something like that in decrypted EBOOT.BIN. What's that? Is it something included in all PSPs? If yes, where can I get more info on it, so I can make use of it, and understand how these files are being used
