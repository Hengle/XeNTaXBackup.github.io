- Post Title: Creating SQ files from midi files

Between 2001/2002, ps2 developers had a program called SMF2SQ.
With that program, they could convert midi music to SQ ps2 music sequence format.
They composed midi music in computer software. Then they converted the Standard Midi File to SQ.
They then made videgames with sequenced music using sony ps2 CSL library driver. CSL stands for Component Sound Library.

I miss SMF2SQ. could someone share it?
