Have you tried "Steven's Gas Machine?" As I remember it worked fine for DW 8, might work nicely for 9 too.

Understand, you had no luck with models (uploaded samples of them). What about textures are they converting fine?

Texture no problem
Steven's does not seem to have time

Yes, I know he's busy. It's good to hear textures are fine. Maybe I will pick this game, thanks to Steven he provided source code for his great tool, so it's shouldn't be too hard to support this game. But will see, since I have some other games in mind too.
