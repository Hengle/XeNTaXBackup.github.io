- Post Title: Extracting Sound effects and Voice clips from a game

Hello and Good Day to those out there,

I had a mod i wanted to make for Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. the mod would basically revolve around magic but it would be magic based on mecha abilities throughout the years. Like the Ward Spells, GaoGaiGar casts a protection shield while yelling protect shade (it sounds cooler with that Japanese pronunciation). here's an example; [https://youtu.be/nF75B325QUY?t=20m18s](https://youtu.be/nF75B325QUY?t=20m18s)

I wanted to bring that to Skyrim even though there is no immersion at all heh. I want to bring fun to the table for skyrim players that know a lot of mecha series and can have their own fun in the game with magic spells based on mecha anime abilities. 

the reason why I asked this side of the gaming mod community is because there might be sound files in a ps3 or psp version of Super Robot Wars and I have had no luck with finding them with UMDgen and such. I probably have no idea of what i am doing. this is my first time doing something this extensive. I was wondering if somebody would help explain how one would go about extracting sound files from a ps3/psp game. I would like to stay in the console generation of when the psp was introduced since the sfx and voice lines will be a bit clearer than the ps2 versions of super robot wars.
