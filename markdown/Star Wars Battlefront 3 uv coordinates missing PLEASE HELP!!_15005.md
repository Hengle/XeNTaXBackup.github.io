- Post Title: Star Wars Battlefront 3 uv coordinates missing PLEASE HELP!!

Hi all!!!

SWBF3 is so crucial to my project!!!...First of all, I am no coder/pro 3d game extractor so any clear suggestions/explanations is much appreciated. 

I am using Ninja Ripper x64 to extract my mesh/texture data from the game and 
3ds Max 2016 x64 to apply textures/rig/animate... No problem locating the desired meshes & textures but and when I apply the correct textures to my mesh using UVunwrap modifier, the UV coordinates/data are somewhat missing as it only displays the 'wrapped' mesh data in the UV editor!?. The seams data is retained but isnt utilised!?

Successfully I've extracted Disney Infinity 3.0 models & imported/applied textures the same method but no luck with Battlefront 3!?
Understood I'm dealing with a different game company/game engine but am positive I can achieve the same results.
I really want to avoid manually remapping the coordinates as some of the texture maps are quite complex and difficult to matchup, not to mention this area aint my strong point.

PLEASE HELP!!!

Please do not open multiple topics with the same request.

Cheers.
