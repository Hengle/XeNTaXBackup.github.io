- Post Title: Superman Returns XMA variant

Hi there!

I recently stumbled upon a strange XMA variant. Not the first time though I can't remember where I've seen it before. It can't be parsed or decoded. I don't know what the three info parts at the start are for but the first one is some block size (if you jump there you can see another stream starting).
Here are two examples: [http://www.gamefront.com/files/20956685 ... rns_xma.7z](http://www.gamefront.com/files/20956685/superman_returns_xma.7z)
Can anyone please take a look and explain how to transform those files into decodable XMA? Thanks!

Regards, Timo
