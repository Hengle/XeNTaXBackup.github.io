It seems, these files are DDS files with modified header. Both are DXT5 compressed.

Of course, because the header based on every converter works, is an unique format of the game. Anf because this is from the X360 version (I think), the texture is swizzled. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swizzling_ ... raphics%29](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swizzling_%28computer_graphics%29)
And I don't know the swizzle methods.
