- Post Title: c# / Lua - 3D Coordinates DataTypes

Hi !

Im still a bit of a scrub when it comes to this, but how would I store the set of coordinates below:-   as i understand it, they would appear as a series of floats  (Half float ?) in the raw data, and one would then convert and store as array of doubles ?

Im not familiar with, but in terms of typical game engine custom types, would this have anything to do with Vector or Quats.  im  a bit put off by the fact there are 7 values , .so im guessing its something like:-  X,Y,Z, scale/width/.length/height  etc.  

Is it a single custom type u think, or perhaps 2 combined, just point me in rough direction, im happy to do some legwork or research (if i know what im looking for )

the code in question:-

SomeObjectNav:Set(6.867891, 1.473541, -23.766327, 0.693505, 0.020854, -0.719862, 0.020331)

(Could be navigation coords, but i mean it referencing static objects,like rooms etc. but i guess it could be movement points for npc too or something :s


thanks, and appreciate everything u guys do, im learning alot
