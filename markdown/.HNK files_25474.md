I didn't understand.
you said that you did not find any messages that could help.
if this thread couldn't help you then i don't know what help you are asking for.  
.hnk is a container that contains  textures, vertex, face indexes, etc. the wii version of barbie is identical to your game. the plugin even opens some models. you just need to complete the plugin.

Thanks I've downloaded it, I'm not sure what to do with this file. I've had no experience with python so do I use it in blender or a python app to use the plugin?

it is for the "noesis" program. 
Drop the path: Noesis/plugin/python. 
I already understood that he is unlikely to help you. 
(Maybe in my free time I'll try to remake it)

Did you ever find a fix? also can you export this to fbx if it's not a issue because many of them still don't open for me.

Hey friend
Do u make this with "Barbie Dreamhouse Party" file too, please?
Are the same format (hbx), but don't open in noesis and the AssestsStudio don't work.

Game link:

I didn’t understand at all what does Asset studio have to do with it.
I already made a plugin for this game:(click on arrow), you posted in the wrong topic.

PC version. (barbie dreamhouse party) *.hnk

**checked. you will need to edit the plugin.
because your game uses a different byte order.
and other chunk identifiers ("type" inside plugin)

```
4176 instead of 4123 (for submesh info)
*offsets inside the submesh block will change (5 >> 4, 138 >> 136)
**and you will need to skip 3 bytes before the loop "for x in range(cmat):" 
***and in your game, the number of faces, not indices, is indicated in the submeshes. so multiply them by 3 (submesh[i][3] *= 3)
84 instead of 29 (for vert buffer)
85 instead of 30 (for indices buffer)

```

after that the plugin will open your models.(of course not all. but you can complete the plugin)

I think the plugin you've made is for another console instead of the PC, but works really great and can even get some meshes from others games made by Torus, sadly there still not script to unpack the Barbie hnk file that have other models in the game, Im used with this type of file "HNK" and from all the games they still be really difficult to extract something, most of them the problem is with the texture

I have tested some others script even bms to unpack, but the data got corrupted or in a .dat format, Torus Games must have been encrypted every platform in a own way

A bit on the same topic, but does anyone know how to rip the music files from the PC version of this game? I can't find the soundtrack anywhere.
