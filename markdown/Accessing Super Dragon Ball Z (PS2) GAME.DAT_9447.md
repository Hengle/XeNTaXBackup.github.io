- Post Title: Accessing Super Dragon Ball Z (PS2) GAME.DAT?

Hi all, long time lurker but finally decided to post for a little help on this pretty old and forgotten game. lol

I was wondering if anyone could take a look at the contents of GAME.DAT on any version of Super Dragon Ball Z. Mainly for the music than to just fiddle around in there. It seems damn near impossible to get the music otherwise, from the looks of it. I'm assuming it's just ADPCM but it seems tricky as it doesn't extract properly using vgmtoolbox or ADPCM player. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
