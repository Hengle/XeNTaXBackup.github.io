Yes I know but I'm not comfortable with that. What is "another" way?

You have to donate to get it. There isn't a freeware version. Even if you got the executable free it still requires a login/password every time you start it up to authenticate that you donated.

Or, of course, if you are a reverse engineer and tried to crack that thing you might get around it.
But then you probably don't need multiex commander in the first place if you can already do that.

The money goes to the efforts of the author that provides the tool and all of the other stuff that comes with it.
Maybe.

It's not donating if you're forcing people to pay for it.

It's paid for software, it is called a donation when yes it is actually pay to use so technically it might not count as a donation but eitherway you can donate like $5 and get it (don't quote me on that).

Alternatively you can do what I did originally, which was advertise the forum/software across the internet (without spamming though), for me this was a year or 2 ago so the rules may be different now. I created a banner and used it in around 10-11 forums for quite a while and mentioned it to Mr Mouse and he offered me a license, but... as I said this was a long time ago now, the rules might be different now, there was less cracking down on reverse engineering etc back then too.

I am curious why donating is something that you're not 'comfortable' with however.

I can't stand people like the OP.  Would you like it if you went in to work (if you even work, you probably don't), and your boss said that he didn't feel 'comfortable' giving you any money for the time you put in for the day?  It's the same thing here.  Mr. Mouse spent time making the program, time in which he didn't have to make the program, or even share it, and also pays money for the server for this website, that he doesn't have to, so people like you have a place to come and cry, and you have the nerve to get mad you have to pay for it.  What an ass.
