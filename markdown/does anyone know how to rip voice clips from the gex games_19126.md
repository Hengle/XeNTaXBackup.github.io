- Post Title: does anyone know how to rip voice clips from the gex games?

there's a ton of great voice lines that i've been wanting to extract and document for a long time
in the prototypes, there are many voice clips that didn't make it to the final game, but the tools i've tried—psound and soulspiral—either don't extract the audio files i need from bigfile.dat or the audio is not extracted properly (it is cut short)
