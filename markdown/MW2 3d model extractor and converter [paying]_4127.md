- Post Title: MW2 3d model extractor and converter [paying]

Hello

I'm in need of Modern Warfare 2 3d models, so I thought I'll post here 
Basically what I need is an extractor to extract the 3d models from mw2 archives and converter to convert them to readable format such as .obj, .3ds, .fbx etc. No need for skeleton and animations, a simple static mesh will do just fine.

What I am offering is, 15-20$ paypal + SmartFoxServer Pro licence (we cracked it and it allows unlimited connections ) which normally costs 2k euros.

Thanks. If you need more info or if you're going to do it, please post.


EDIT:
just a quick note, do not suggest DX Ripper to "rip" the models from inside game. It takes ages and it sucks -.-
