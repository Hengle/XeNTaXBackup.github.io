okay i found out how to fix the files so you are able to hear it this is how i did it 

i used unxwb, xmash and towav

i took my xwb and extracted the files with unxwb  then  i dragged the .wav/xma file on to xmash to encode it  then the last 
step drag the new file that was made by xmash on to towav to code it back to .wav to hear the audio from the game
