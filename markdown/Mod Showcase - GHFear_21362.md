- Post Title: Mod Showcase - GHFear

WELCOME!

This is a mod showcase for my game mods.
Been researching a couple engines like RenderWare 4, Unity and Unreal Engine 4 over the last 2½ years and gotten a lot of great mods working that I want to share with people.
None of the mods I share or make are ever on multiplayer games. I don't support cheats.
I just make mods for single player experiences to make the experience feel more aimed towards me 

SESSION:

This is a full map rip from Skate 3 ported over to Unreal Engine 4.



This is a custom map mod for the game Session.

Took a lot of hours to get all this figured out and this was done before I got my hands on scripts for porting RenderWare4/EA Skate 3D models.
So the whole map was ported by hand with 3D Model Researcher.

Nice job! How is the game Session btw? Does it feel at least similar to Sk8 3? Also, did you try porting over other parts of skate map like the Super Ultra Mega Park or the University Cubes art thing?

The game is great  I love it.
Very steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of the controls, it's just amazing.
It's nothing like EA Skate tbh, but it's got huge potential and what's there already is really nice. 
I have some plans to port over more of the maps from the Skate games, but it takes a really long time to do, so don't expect anything soon.
If you don't have the game already, you should totally get a copy and try it  out!

Yeah I watched some more videos on this and it seems really great. It has a learning curve that makes it kinda realistic as well. Is there any guide to porting maps like you are tho? Just curious. Like what do you use would be nice to have a little guide doesn't have to be really detailed. Ex I imported to blender than used this to export to game. I read bottom of post and already know that but was curious about the Session related stuff like the import to Session.
