- Post Title: Rumble Roses XX Modded (another one?)

Hello everyone, I am starting yet again another Rumble Roses(XX) modding thread. I feel Most or all of these are abandoned but lets not make this one  another abandon post (Just gonna say that before I start). Okay this is just a copy and paste from this thread [https://boards.4chan.org/3/res/319836](https://boards.4chan.org/3/res/319836) here it goes! 

Post 1:
Hey /3/ (or XeNTaX in this sense), this is my first time posting on here and I wanna talk about a mod for a certain game. Rumble Roses! In July a few screenshots of the game Rumble Roses XX with nude models was released on a Japanese site ([http://www.coregrafx.info/sexy/index.html](http://www.coregrafx.info/sexy/index.html)). OP released very very brief hard to understand instruction in Japanese of how to do this (He was either too lazy to upload the patch or just a faggot). I'm almost sure any archive of the instructions or the photos have been deleted or lost, the instructions were poor and any one who did read them said that the translation was shit. So I come here today asking for help. I say we start here and move this thread over somewhere more permanent ([http://forum.xentax.com/](http://forum.xentax.com/)). We need modders mainly, someone who could model these girls. Any pervs up for this mod?

A few tools
Xpacker 8.1: ([http://www.mediafire.com/?oxyr77l2rfrfglg](http://www.mediafire.com/?oxyr77l2rfrfglg))
Quickbms: ([http://www.4shared.com/zip/6rxMfN-R/qui ... tract.html](http://www.4shared.com/zip/6rxMfN-R/quickbms_generic_files_extract.html))
I believe these were the program that were used on the Japanese forum, JS2Edit might have been used, I'm not sure. Ether way, here is JS2Edit and JS2Mesh
JS2Edit: ([http://www.mediafire.com/?e1n15r6y2v3pc6a](http://www.mediafire.com/?e1n15r6y2v3pc6a))

JS2Edit link doesn't work. Sorry I should have check before hand, I'll keep looking for a working one.
I've been doing more searching and It seems you could follow any tutorial on most of the SVR games and still get the same results for RRXX.

Alright XeNTaX, lets see what we can do. I also have a question to add, can we compile the .yobj files?

Illusion's .xx format is completely unrelated if the only thing in common is the fact that the word "XX" is in the name of the game. It is a proprietary format used by that company for most of their 3D assets.

In any case, I think it would be better to look for a community that focuses on actual modding.

Here is computer-translated version of coregrafx's modding procedure.

But I couldn't understand what the "pac header" is.
Any help?

Just wait until I release my Yukes PAC Archiver.  You'll be able to mod the hell out of it.

Sorry for the necrobump, but was this nude mod ever completed?

If so, can someone at least pinpoint me in the 
direction of where it can be found or where it was last seen?
If not, that's ok, I'll just keep wandering around the internet on my endless
journey in search of the sacred treasure that is the Rumble Roses XX Nude Mod.

I've added support for the models in the next version of X-Rey. Beta testing at the moment but I can confirm that uv and vertice editing is possible and works in game:

in the game you can mix parts to customize your character. So there is a folder that has model parts like arms, legs, chests, torsos, hairs etc

and with some of the model parts they left some underlying geometry, like it says there the gym shirt.
which I checked and the full chest model is present underneath
 

so probably what they did was hex the pac files so that the gym shirt was pared with another mesh part that was best to exploit. 
then they just load the costume in through the customize window

there's alot of hexing there because they have to hex to remove clothing parts, then hex the PAC to re-address the other mesh part

those guys sure are good at creating nude hacks with a hex editor lol

I just finished scripting a vertex editor, so that original hack can be repeated but in much more easier way.

just unpack the files, edit, repack, WIN

I tried the doing a similar hack but using the DLC instead, which only is a few mbs and is faster to deal with then the large GB large PAC files found on the disc

The most recent version of X-Rey supports editing of the models, confirmed to be working game. 

@mariokart, great work

I recorded video discussing how to vertex in 3dsmax, how to mod the DLC packages, and the inner workings of the file format

If your interested the playlist is here, included in the video's description are the links to the maxscript I wrote for this nude mod
