- Post Title: Airline Tycoon Deluxe and the Game Extractor trouble

Hi all, I wanted to extract the graphics from Airline Tycoon Deluxe. Please keep in mind that I'm completely new to all this. Game uses .gli and .glj archives which are read by the Game Extractor, I can open them, but nothing else. I can't see any graphics there, don't know where the actual files are stored that the archives refer to. Could you help me please? I can't find anything on extracting from the game on the Internet.
