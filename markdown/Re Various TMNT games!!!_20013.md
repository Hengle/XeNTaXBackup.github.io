I don't know it will be helpful for you, but I have made some research recently on TMNT 2003. Here are the files -> [https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools ... MNT%202003](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/tree/master/NEW%20Tools/TMNT%202003)

Models are probably in DFF files. You should check them.
