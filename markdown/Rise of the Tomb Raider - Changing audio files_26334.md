- Post Title: Rise of the Tomb Raider - Changing audio files

Hi, 
Arabic dub only available on PS4 version 
I got the Arabic files from the PS4 , but a simple copy paste doesn't work

Is there any way to change audios in the .tiger files, so I can extract them from the ps4 files and put them in another language file for example ? 

If any one can help me, I can share all needed files 

Thank you in advance
