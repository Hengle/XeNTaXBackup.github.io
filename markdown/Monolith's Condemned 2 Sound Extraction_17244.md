- Post Title: Monolith's Condemned 2 Sound Extraction

So, I managed to extract files from Layer.Arch02 and I got a lot of files with extensions like .bndl, .mdl, .strdb and bunch of others. I'm looking for audio files and I believe they might be extracted from the sounddb.gamedb file. Is there any script for it actually?

You know... I personally think that these Arch-files are not fully extracted. Judging by F.E.A.R. and Condemned: Criminal Origins files, i think sounds and music are supposed to be in snd folder, but as you can see, it's empty. I haven't tried anything with this gamedb file though, but it's probably contains just names for these sound files.
It's truly one of the hardest games to extract anything from)
By the way, how exactly have you unpacked Arch-files?
