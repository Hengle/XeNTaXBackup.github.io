Usually you should post the first 10MB of the file for people to take a look at.

Use this to help you find the password to the FSB archive and also decrypt it:

Use guessfsb.exe to identify the password and then use decfsb.exe to decrypt the FSB.

After that, use fsbii to unpack the decrypted FSB file.

Thanks goes out to HCS for coding these tools

guessfsb doesn't work on this game (at least not the version I was given a sample for)

Well, the password should be in the first 100-200 bytes of the file IIRC.
