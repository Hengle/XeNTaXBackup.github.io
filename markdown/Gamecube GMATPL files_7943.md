- Post Title: Gamecube GMA/TPL files

Hello, I'm currently looking for a way to extract 3d models and textures from gamecube .gma and .tpl files and also be able to repackage the extracted files back into the proprietary .gma and .tpl file format.  

I used GameZelda's f-zero GX model viewer to view and even extract the model and textures from .GMA and .TPL files from Super Monkey Ball 2 (it extracts to a .obj/.mtl type model, I believe is referred to as lightwave 3d model that opend in deled 3d editor, along with a bunch of .png graphics files)

The problem I'm having is getting the .GMA and .TPL files back together again.  It appears that the .GMA file contains the model while the .TPL file has all the textures needed for the model.  

Is anyone familiar with repackaging gamecube .GMA and .TPL files from a bunch of .png files and a a 3d model in the .obj/.mtl format?

I'm trying to make modified versions of the boards in the Monkey Target 2 party game, fyi, the models for those are labeled stage155, stage156, and stage157, under the stages folder.
