I already tried that; it produces files which cannot be played.

If you're in such "urgent need", then maybe you should consider using the forums search function or looking at similar threads, e.g. [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=6376) or on aluigis page.
This way, I found the solution to your problem within 5 minutes:
1.extract the xwbs using unxwb
2. decode the wavs using XMAEncode /X
3. play them
