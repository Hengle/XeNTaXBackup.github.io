- Post Title: Terraria - Openin the exe for translation

I need the texts of this file, but texts are in the .exe file.
I asked a dude who made a translation for Russian, he told me that I have to download a decompiler and XNA Game Studio. And Decompile the exe, then edit it with XNA...

The thing is, I'm a total noob in programming...   

Can someone help me? And is it allowed the upload the game's exe file?

A little bump...
I can see the texts with "Reflector", but -thanks to my advanced programming skills - I cannot edit it.
