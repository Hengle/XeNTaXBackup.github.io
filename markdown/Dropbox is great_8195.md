- Post Title: Dropbox is great

So I'm lazy.
I write a bunch of noesis plugins but they're mostly incomplete.
I figure I'll get back to them when I figure out more of this 3D stuff.

So the stuff is just sitting there gathering dust.

Then I remembered dropbox had public folders and so I thought maybe I could just use that.

And what do you know, it works well lol
Dropbox has their bandwidth restrictions (so if they observe way too much activity eg gigs they'll block you), but these are just scripts so it isn't much of an issue.

Absolutely no guarantee whether one will work or not.
No indication whether they are complete or WIP. It should at least load the geometries at the very least before I toss it in.

You can improve on it or use them for reference freely.

I actually keep all my code on google code. Works great so far. You don't have to have a published project to keep your account so it's worked great for me. No matter where I am as long as I have a computer with svn I can work on my code.

Oh ya, SVN is a good idea also.
Though, I imagine a lot of people don't know how to use SVN lol

google code has an option to browse repositories in the browser?

yes, all the projects there can be navigated via browser and doesn't matter if they use svn or git or something else.
