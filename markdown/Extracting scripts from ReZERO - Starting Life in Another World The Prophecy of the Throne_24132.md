- Post Title: Extracting scripts from Re:ZERO - Starting Life in Another World: The Prophecy of the Throne

I don't know if I should post this here or in game localization, but this is my problem:
I would like to translate the visual novel, re:zero the prophecy of the throne, into my native language, Spanish. But I don't know how to extract the scripts from the game and then inject them again (I'm a noob in game file hacking). Could someone tell me how to do it?

It seems that this script works fine with your sample [https://aluigi.org/bms/zero_time_dilemma.bms](https://aluigi.org/bms/zero_time_dilemma.bms)
You can use it with quickbms [http://aluigi.zenhax.com/quickbms.htm](http://aluigi.zenhax.com/quickbms.htm)
