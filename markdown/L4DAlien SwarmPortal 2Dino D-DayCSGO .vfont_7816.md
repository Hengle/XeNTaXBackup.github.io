Does anybody have specifications of Valve's font format used in Source engine games after The Orange Box? There is public\BitmapFontFile.h file in ASw sources, but it tells me nothing because I don't see the header in any .vfont file, and the fonts do not appear to be ICE-encrypted, because there's no encryption key in Alien Swarm, and when I decrypt them in L4D2, I get nothing useful.

Half Life 2 source code was leaked some time ago. It probably contains font handling code.

"Recently the online world has been set ablaze by a Vietnamese beta tester who leaked the source code for Valveâ€™s upcoming Dota 2 and as expected enthusiasts all around the world are picking its bones dry like vultures and in the process they revealed a code snippet that suggests Valve might be working on Half Life Episode 3."

HL2 was leaked in 2003, when .ttf fonts were still used, .vfont's were introduced in 2008 in Left 4 Dead.

They revealed only file names in directory structure. The files were most likely removed from the CBT after the leak.
