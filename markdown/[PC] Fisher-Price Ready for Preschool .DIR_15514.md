- Post Title: [PC] Fisher-Price Ready for Preschool .DIR

Hello there.

I was wondering if anyone could help me with this topic.
See, I want to extract resources from PC Software Programs from across the 90's so that I can post them to resource sites -to preserve their nostalgia and not to be forgotten.

But, unfortunately, the one program that I wanted to extract the most, turns out to be in a nigh impossible file format to crack due to the need of "Lingo" to open it... (Google wasn't helpful, and Shockwave script with Quickbms extracted the file as meaningless .DAT files)...

I have a sample -along with some other stuff- for anyone to analyze, and can provide more if asked.

Thank you for reading this topic and for the assistance.
