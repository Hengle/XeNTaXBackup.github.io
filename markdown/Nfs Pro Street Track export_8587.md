Hy! I want to export the tracks from NFS ProStreet. I found a program which can export the tracks from nfs shit, but after i unpack them with a bms script.  This is the program [http://imageshack.us/a/img138/1148/76996227.jpg](http://imageshack.us/a/img138/1148/76996227.jpg) . Butit can't import the .bun file from prostreet [http://imageshack.us/a/img443/7639/untitlessd1.jpg](http://imageshack.us/a/img443/7639/untitlessd1.jpg) . I was wondering if there is any prgoram which can extract he bun files? Or if you guys have any other idea about how to export the tracks from Nfs ProStreet and import them in 3ds Max.
