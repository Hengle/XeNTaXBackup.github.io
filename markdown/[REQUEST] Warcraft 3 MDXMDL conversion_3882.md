- Post Title: [REQUEST] Warcraft 3 MDX/MDL conversion

I found means to convert the geometry but this always strips the bone and animation data which I really don't want. There is a means to convert to a text MDL format, but the MDL itself is incompatible with any other translation than back to MDX.

Now what I am aiming for is a means to convert to MD2/MD3 or some other common intermediary animated format that can be easily converted to MD2 or MD3. There DOES exist a converter that converts a MDX to MD3, however it is buggy and seems to crash on a more complex model.

I tried the MDX importer for GMax, which really messed up the animations. This is for a silly little community project and one person's avatar is Xemnas but there's none in a format usable with GZDoom (MD2 and MD3). Thanks for any help.

I've attached the MDL file with each texture converted to TGA for ease.

All-in-all, I need a means to import properly, and export with decent quality in a format I can use with animation data intact and working well enough.
