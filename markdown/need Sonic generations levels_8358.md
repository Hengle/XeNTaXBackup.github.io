and here is the 3D environment artist's- [http://owen-c.deviantart.com/](http://owen-c.deviantart.com/) - [http://itsmadman.deviantart.com/](http://itsmadman.deviantart.com/) it would really help out if I had green hill zone from sonic generations ripped with textures for 3d max 2011 we will use it as a guide for things like poly count textures etc,
also need it to figure out level layout.
