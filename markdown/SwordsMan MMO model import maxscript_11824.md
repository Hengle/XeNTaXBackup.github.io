Hi guys! Here's maxscript to import SwordsMan models with bones+weights (3ds max 2009-2012)
You should rename models from their original names in order for script to work. When format wil be more finished,
I'll try to re-write script to fix the problem with renaming files . 

P.S. Feel freely to post here models which doesn't work (or send them the via PM), I'll update script ASAP. My amount of samples from this game was limited



EDIT: Fixed script for new samples

EDIT: Updated for PL Hair styles

Here, two scripts for models and for bones - so you can import or bones or mesh like you want  If you find correct model, the one you need with bones and weights. Just import bones for this model first and then model itself, script will pick right bones for you! It's the easiest way for me right now, since script isn't finished yet so I don't want to re-write it in such a "beta" state

EDIT: Weapons should work fine now

ok here upload more samples of weapons, some of them won't load, and about importer, is possible save path from the last open file? because when we go to open maxscript again we lose the last path where we load file.

Let me ask again, since it's important.
Does script will work in future with animation ? Is it hard to create one ?

Sadly yes, but this is always better than nothin   People started creating private servers, maybe there will be more tools like this. 

I know that bulding models are in .chf, is there any way to import this to 3ds max? Or should I use 3dripper dx atm?

Using applocale with code page it generates correct filenames.

For example
1. Change all foreign path or exe names to english.
  For example change exe name to PCKTools.exe
2. install applocale and make link with

C:\Windows\AppPatch\AppLoc.exe "<Your pckTools Directory>\PCKTools.exe" "/L0804"

3. If your installed game path includes chinese or foreign name, change it to english

then run and extract.

1 button - select .pck file
2 button - extract (same location as exe file)this unpacker no work for models.pck.

In fact, there are at least 3 versions of client. chinese original, english and korean.

chinese
[http://xa.wanmei.com/](http://xa.wanmei.com/)
english
[http://www.arcgames.com/en/games/swordsman](http://www.arcgames.com/en/games/swordsman)
korena
[http://xa.nextgamelife.com/](http://xa.nextgamelife.com/)

My area is banned from arcgames, so I can not talk about english version.
So I have tested with korean and chinese version.

Chinese version's model files are large than 4G, so it is splitted to 2 parts with name models.pck and models.pkx
(Version 1.4.38 at the time of writing this article.)
May be older client has smaller size and PCK编辑器(this is original name of extracter) may work.
Korean client has smaller single model file and PCK编辑器 works fine.

The Problem is the information about the location of the table of archived file names are stored in the last part of file. So splitted chinese versions can not be handled with old programs.
I've tested with a combined file, but no luck.

Also there is a bug that if it fails to load new one then it still contains previously loaded list and extract that old one.
So carefull that it appears to work but it may not be true.

Also some anti-virus programs are trigger by this extracter. My avast generates malware-gen. May be false alarm?

There is a source code for extracter for another game's PCK at [http://pan.baidu.com/s/1jGBktQe](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1jGBktQe) password: bffd
You must edit \WinPCK\CPckClass\PckHeader.h for swordsman and
quickbms script hints some values for swordsman.

0x62A4F9E1
0x3520C3D5

other values are not certain.

P.S.

quickbms script at
[http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=99&start=5](http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=99&start=5)
seems more reliable for single file pck.

If your system supports unicode, use applocale to cmd.exe with chinese simplified locale and using script generates correct file name.
