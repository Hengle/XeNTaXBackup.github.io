- Post Title: [Request] Transformers Prime the Game (WiiU)

So I was looking at the files for the Wii U version of Transformers Prime and most the data for the game is in *.dat files.
I think I found some models in the d02.dat file, but I can only seem to get verts and not faces using Hex2obj. I cut out some samples from the file which can be found here

Maybe someone could help me out? The full d02.dat file is ~15MB so I can upload that if needed.
