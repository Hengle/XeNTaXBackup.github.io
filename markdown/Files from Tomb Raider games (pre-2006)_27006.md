- Post Title: Files from Tomb Raider games (pre-2006)

*.phd = Tomb Raider (1996)
*.tr2 = 2 and 3
*.tr4
*.trc = Chronicles
*.gmx/*.awd/*.clz = Angel of Darkness

I got no filenames in all formats. Are there programs that can unpack 3D models and other data from all classic Tomb Raider games (pre-2006)?

Its been decades since I dabbled with classic TR modding, but if I recall TRViewer lets you open compiled TR files. Fexinspect lets you view levels. 

Those tools should be available here:

Also check out tombraiderforums.com for a more in depth guide to modding. After the release of Tomb Raider Chronicles Core Design released the level editor used in production (Tomb Raider Level Editor - TRLE) so the formats are pretty extensively researched. 

For AOD tools (plus other tools for the earlier games) check out this link:

Finally for AOD and some of the later classic games, the original devs recently released some of the orignial assets including cut content, which can be found here

Hope it helps.
