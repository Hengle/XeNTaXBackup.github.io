Well it Crashes When on this level (importing skeleton), thank god it imports the mesh   , anyway if i created an fig file for infantry, it will be easy to use on all of them but the problem is that the mesh is too small take a look at the attachment and see if you can create a biped for her and save the fig file.

thx for your help

Please don't spam a rant, it's not helpful.

Anyhow, it's simple, you need to learn how to use 3DS MAX as any other software. Some people spend YEARS, since 3DS Max isn't simply a single animation process. If you don't have time to learn it, then don't bother. Stick with Poser.

As for the Rise and Fall rigging issues...I don't understand what happened to the model!

The normals seem to be in the correct position, but they also look flipped. I had to export and RE-import the model in OBJ format to get it to work properly.

As for the Biped rigging. Just created Biped System, go to Figure mode, select the WHOLE biped, scale it to the model, and Skin it.

Simple as that.

I have no idea how Rise and Fall works, so please, note I'm just talking for the 3DS Max side of things.
