- Post Title: Extracting models from Wizards Unite

Hello, it may be rather soon to write about this as the game was only launched around 2 days ago but I've been rather intrigued with the models in the game. Wizards Unite is only on mobile and when attempting to run it with Nox/Bluestacks, you can't get past the login stage (Similar to Pokemon Go where you can't authenticate with emulators).
I was wondering if anyone was able to extract the models for this game, I know that you can get the apk/ipa to .zip and extract the assets there but you can't find the model files in there. Is anyone able to share some knowledge on how to export from Wizards Unite? I believe it should be similar on how to export from Pokemon Go but I can't find that much information about that either. I'd greatly appreciate any knowledge, thank you!

Looks like typical Unity game. There are a lot of differrent converters, [Perfare's AssetStudio](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Perfare/assetstudio/branch/master/artifacts) as example.

Hey, thanks for the reply.

The game is indeed running on Unity yes, as mentioned you can get the .apk's into .zip's and then use AssetStudio to extract/view the files but the only files there are the icons and some little effects, none of the actual assets like models can be found in there. Within the game you can download all assets which seems like it would also download the models but the problem is I can't run the game on an emulator as it won't login.

I ran into the same problem mentioned here, but I'm on the other game which is similar to Wizards Unite - Pokémon GO. Tried going with BlueStacks but it fails to authenticate me... So I went ahead and copied the folder from the data section on my Android smartphone over to my computer (yes, this works with a simple USB connection!) - only to find out with AssetStudio that there are some model files in it, but not those I want. I got all the Pokémon, but I didn't get the characters, especially the player characters :/

EDIT says:
I got to the model files for the player characters with the APK and found them in there. Now I gotta sort things out... And the picture attached is the model I want: The Cliff-Style Outfit on a male player. Screenshot's taken directly from the game and edited
