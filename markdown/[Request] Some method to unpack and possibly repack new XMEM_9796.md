- Post Title: [Request] Some method to unpack and possibly repack new XMEM

While I have a method to compress to XMEM, it is cumbersome and requires a copyrighted program.
[Here are some sample files](http://home.comcast.net/~selyb/XMEM_Examples.zip).
The txt files are compressed to .bin

The closest "legal" solution without reimplementing it yourself is to make use of the XnaNative DLL installed on a users system.

Could one of you hook me up with an unpack script?
[Here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=8679) chrrox offered one for those files. I downloaded noesis and looked at the included scripts but I couldn't really follow them.
