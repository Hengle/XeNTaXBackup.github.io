- Post Title: Unity .sprite files

How can I convert these Unity .sprite files to .dds, .png, .tex or any other graphic format?

Thanks for your help!

Do you have any in-game screenshots of those sprites?
To me the files look like to be in a 3D format (vertices and faces).

.sprite format does not contain an image. It can have a mask of vertices and faces for the sprite image.
