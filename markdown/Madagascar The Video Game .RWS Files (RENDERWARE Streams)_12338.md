Hello! Need some help figuring out a method to play .RWS music files from Madagascar 1. Thanks in advance (samples are joined).

Well, first off, good job figuring out how to get the songs! I am guessing, as you said, it is the offset.

What's the codec?

The file is just one big Sony ADPCM stream it seems, but the table in the beginning of the file seems to have offsets for where each individual track begins.
I don't know if these streams can loop, if they can it might also contain an offset for where the song loops.

I'd happily take a high dive into the bowels of these streams (& the archive as-a-whole) if you're still interested?
I do realise you made this post/request quite some many months ago, but in light of the reality that I've been drifting about on a faraway planet for the last 24 months or-so, it was only once back in this familiar ecosystem, from where upon a momentary impulse to revisit the nigh-forgotten House of Xen when my eyes caught sight of so many unsolved quandries.

Also it just became bluntly apparent to me that any idea I might've had (i.e none whatsoever) as a prospective recognised & famed author of deep prose are practically worth the weight they carry in volumes of flatulent gas   

If you haven't yet abolished all hope for your thread topic, perhaps you could be so kind as to reupload the sample archive for me to peruse at my leisure? Renderware streams have long been a love/hate companion of mine, so it's not at all improbable that I have a shred of wisdom to throw your way 

ALAKAZAM!
Let me know, either way. (or don't - it's entirely up to you bud)

Solved: .RWS music files have subsongs inside. They use the standard PS 4-bit ADPCM codec.
