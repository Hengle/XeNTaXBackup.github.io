- Post Title: known instances of games companies attacking modders?

Does anyone know of any instances of games companies specifically attacking (either with take down notices/legal threats or polite requests) modders and people reverse engineering their games?

The ones I am aware of:
Blizzard attacking bnetd
Blizzard attacking people modding WoW (because of the issue that any mods for MMOs can be considered cheating)
EA Sports attacking at least one modder of one of their Formula 1 titles because they were putting newer season drivers/teams/tracks/data into an older title (so depriving EA of revenue from the newer titles)
EA attacking people modding the scripting for one of the Sims titles because people were making all sorts of new objects and thus making the many expansion packs a lot less attracting to players or something)
Telltale going after someone who made a decryption tool for one of their games.
Frontier going after my Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 modding tools (this one didnt actually happen but I heard some rumors that Frontier didnt like the tools I made and was considering legal action of some kind)

Anyone know of any more ideas?

Note that I am not talking about companies that use encryption or protection on their games or companies that have gone after someone for releasing things that are clearly cheats or purely for piracy, just companies that have gone after someone for reverse engineering their game for the purposes of making mods or for distributing mods for their game. (I am also not talking about mods that are shut down because of pure copyright violations like HaloGen)

I know SquareSoft/Square Enix/SquareBox/Squarewhatever we call ourselves now, emailed Hal-kun and a few others over at Quimms board, Saying about taking apart Q-gears which is why Qg-ears makes a stand for you having to OWN the disc to do anything at all in the game from now on.

Though speaking of Q-gears...its not exactly moving fast for these past few years.

The Team Ninja thing is a little different because its an X-Box game and not a PC game (and all the stuff attached to the fact that you cant modify an X-Box game and play the changed disk without making a copy of it (and using a mod chip or soft mod) which is much the same as pirating it.

As for Q-Gears, from reading that link it seems like Squaresoft are mainly concerned about people using Q-Gears along with a non-legit copy of the game data (i.e. piracy) or about unauthorized reuse of Squaresoft IP (ala the Chrono Trigger fan games) and not so much about the mod itself.
The attack on bnetd was all about piracy (including piracy of the Beta version of Warcraft 3 which was in testing at the time)
As for the Frontier issue, the rumored reason why they didnt support custom 3D objects and why they didnt like my tools is because their engine sucked and couldn't handle large amounts of objects (which is true even for the stock objects) and that custom objects would not be as optimized as the stock objects, thus leading to even more lag (and even more complaints).

about Telltale, the author of that tool wrote that Telltale simply asked him to not updating his tools so nothing like a complete removing or a legal menace: [http://quick.mixnmojo.com/telltale-tools-an-update](http://quick.mixnmojo.com/telltale-tools-an-update)

while I can add to the list the works of xorloser that he removed due to request of Microsoft (for xex and other tools) and others (like the guitar hero or rock band developers for arktool).

P.S.: the sentence "(and using a mod chip or soft mod) which is much the same as pirating it" is just wrong at least for personal experience with the xbox which, for example, uses a custom ISO file system and some protections so if you want to mod a game you must mod the console too... and logically if I buy a xbox I can use as I want, even for preparing the coffee. I have bought it and now it's mine

Well it's not really about attacking but Ubisoft is kind of doing that stuff. Especially about the Settlers 2 series. Not only that they use a ridiculously insane encryption algorithm, they also supress anything on their forums regarding mods or the like.

@ jfwfreo... what link?i didn't post a link of any sort...

As for owning a console and a game means you have the rights to do whatever with it so long as its not distributed and whatnot...Personally...i myself agree...BUT when you buy a game console or a game cd...you agree to the terms and conditions and reverse engineering and pretty much everything else IS in there...so even though you purchase it, you still cant do that kinda thing because you agreed not to when you agreed to the terms and conditions..and no1 ever reads those everyone complains later on.

I myself agree with I own it..even tho i understand i don't own the source or anything like that...But i technically own the right to make 2 unrelated game characters battle if i so choose. But that's only from a technical standpoint anyways...From a legal standpoint pretty much doing anything with a game is illegal, and TECHNICALLY the use of a gameshark is illegal as its modifying the games programming, sure its not able to change it because its on a CD but it is technically stealing a section of code and modifying it and saving it to the ram of the console and that's how the cheat works, or at least thats my understanding as you cannot edit the data on the cd/DVD as its read only so thus everything is done through ram and whatnot. Although you didnt HACK the game with the game shark yourself you are in a way committing the crime by using the product itself...though because of a few loopholes here and there game sharks get away with things purely because they don't extract anything from the games or edit the game discs or consoles in any way... But that doesn't go to say that game developers LIKE those...as if someone was good enough they'd be able to take ram dumps and possibly with enough time, effort, and lack of an actual life...be able to reverse engineer the entire game purely through ram dumping and the game shark.

(Someone is gonna completely put me down for that...i just know it...).

Thats how i see it, but that wont stop me looking at models and textures...as that's all i do, look at them, but even owning them is a liability in the laws eyes i suppose...its all a little simple whilst at the same time being overall complicated due to loopholes and intellectual property and whatnot.

Seriously...dont bust me for that post...that d be stupid...though feel free to explain something...i just hate posts that say "your stupid"  or "thats wrong" and nothing more..

As Bugtest (and my old post) said, Telltale didn't issue me with a takedown or C+D. What actually happened was that I was dumb.

I had just finished making a new version of Telltale Explorer, which added support for reading and decrypting ttarchs/files (much like Bugtest's recent tool does). I'd spent ages on it and was pretty pleased with myself; I excitedly messaged a friend to share the good news, forgetting that he actually worked...at Telltale Games.

He was duty bound to tell his boss (the person who devised the ttarch and encryption), who asked me to send him an email before releasing it. He replied, explaining that he wasn't opposed to tools like it per-se but that the licence holders and investors required them to protect the resources. He requested that I not release it and was very amenable. His argument was essentially that an arms-race would ensue - with TT having to divert resources to further protecting the datafiles and away from making games.

As a big fan of Telltale's games and considering the reasonable way they dealt with the issue I agreed not to release it. Since then I've kept to a self-imposed rule of not including any Telltale resource decryption code in my tools.

What does the story show? Well essentially, that I can be an idiot, but also that not all companies are as bad as some of the others mentioned in this thread.

They didn't ask me to stop updating my tools though, I've continued to update my Telltale Music and Speech Extractor tools. I've just had to work around issues with the encryption.

For Q-Gears, my fault, the "link" I was talking about was actually something I saw on google about it.

XEX tools (and such things) are all about MS not wanting reverse engineering for piracy purposes.

For consoles (at least on current gen), to pirate a game, you do <some steps>. To mod a game,you do the same steps only you change the game data a bit before you make the copy.
AFAIK There is no difference between a pirated copy of Guitar Hero (for example) and a modded copy other than that the owner of the modded copy has a legit original on his shelf and that the modded copy has some data changes. So any console hacking is too close to piracy for the companies tastes. Guitar Hero and Rock Band and related games also, the companies are worried about piracy of content (e.g. someone posting songs from one game for use in another game)

Thanks for the post about Telltale bgbennyboy.

Thankfully none of the games I have ever modded (with the possible exception of that Rollercoaster Tycoon thing) have had any legal or technical obstacles. 
None of the C&C series for example has had any issues whatsoever, in fact the only thing stopping EALA being even more mod friendly is 3rd party IP issues (MP3 patents, Adobe Flash licensing for the UI) and lack of resources.

Seriously...i didnt know that...Well i guess im cool then eventually at least...(Im planning to move to Germany once university is over to work for a German games company in Berlin...if anyone actually wants to hire me that is...so anyone German or living in Germany here...any help you can provide would be awesome ^_^).

Many people don't realize that when software (in this case a game) is purchased, you do not "own" the software itself; you've actually purchased a license to use that software. The software publisher retains all rights, including copyrights, to the software and accompanying media. The EULA document outlines the terms of the software license, spelling out all rights and restrictions relating to the ownership, use, distribution, and warranty of the software product.

No i didnt write that...Its a copy paste that i added "a game" to...before anyone points out i didnt write it myself..
