If sporemaster not extract them with names, then probably won't get them as such given EA's system is rather complex in referencing the files by hashes.

Those two types stand for streamed audio and non-streamed audio instead of actual audio formats and only use different file layout and both use EA's two codecs depending on file like the mentioned EALayer3 (MP3)

Extraction is pain however given the various manipulations needed that may not be capable of being automated.

Ok, skip the file names. Anyone knows a way of extracting the sound from all/some of the files I uploaded ? I need all of the Spore's sound I can get. The more the better. I'll more than happy if someone gives me the tool or some other instructions to follow. Thanks!

Well, I know how to but I do it manually for most part myself (hex editing and cutting) in my EA ripping hobby and ealayer3 tool will only do files that use ealayer3. Especially streamed files do pose a problem as they do not specify khz or channel information as its kept elsewhere than in actual audio file and thus any automated tool will have to be set with a guess value thats common and potentially wrong in some cases, exception to this is ealayer3 files thus why I said pain to extract apart from lack of direct tools.

Thanks for that. But what should I do ? I'm sure idling won't help. I thought that extracting audio out of SPORE is pretty simple, it's been about 4 years since the release. I'm not near as good as you people, so I can't do anything on my own about it. There's got to be a way to do this. Thanks for all the details and info!

Ok, I looked through those files. Files are all different.

Two files are MP3, so can be converted with Ealayer3 (one with header, another without, they convert anyway)

Two other files are XAS ADPCM, one with header, another without. With some degree of automation they can be converted too.

XAS ADPCM is one of most used formats by EA. There are many tools that can decode it.

Maybe "VideoGameSoundConverter_2.0" will help.
Decodes lot of EA music.
