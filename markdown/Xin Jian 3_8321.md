Yes, same game.

I looked at a couple of the chunks that are output and found some path references. Though, this could likely be part of one of the files.

Where might they store it if it's not in the archives? There doesn't seem to be a separate file table either.

The game itself has very little files outside of the pak's. Just a bunch of dll's for the client. It also has a few data folders that were unpacked which contains the directory structure, and each of the folders contains only one file, but that probably doesn't give much of a hint.
