sorry i missed.

do anyone know where the wepons & items aswell as textures are?.

im thinking that there in the bundlfiles im each of the location layers but im not shure.

also thinking that certin wepons will be in the l8ter files as you only get those wepons as you progress in the game.

In my opionion you should like to do these these things:

1) Find out what problem you REALLY have (sorry, I didn't get it - maybe of my limited English language knowledge)

and:

2) Try to enunciate your problem(s) into common understandable sentences so anybody who gets interested in your thread is able to get introducted with it.

ok srry.

i can extract the arch files no problem.

but i cant extract the bundle files that come out of the arch files. iv tryed graw bundle extractor "thats all iv got & it can extract some other bundle file s i had"

i did extract arch file 0 & it has mdl's of almost everything from wepons to veichles. but no 3d program iv use sofar can open the mdl's.

i get mdl signature mismatch when trying to do so.

i downloaded a bundle extractor from a diffrent thread but that didnt work for me?

-

i guess what im asking is, do anyone know how i can extract these bundle files & then ill try from there
