- Post Title: PUBG model extraction

I found this topic on umodel's forum - [https://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,3229.0.html](https://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,3229.0.html)
It has a custom umodel version and a current AES key to open PUBG archives. However it is currently impossible to extract characters from the game. Can anybody help me with this?
