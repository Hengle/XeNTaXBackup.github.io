Hi,

I just extracted all the sound files from Prince of Persia The Two Thrones.
They are .sb0 files. But how can I play, or better, convert them?
I tried the popsottools and popwwtools, but they always say that it is a bad sb0 file. But it's not!
I hope you can help me converting them into wavs or mp3s...

Thanks,
me.   

EDIT -> Okay, I'm already a bit further. I managed to extract a large .ss0 file ( 232mb ) and now, I can't open it!

Check [this post/thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=12537#12537). I might do an interim fix that converts the TTT SB0 files to SOT/WW format so they can be extracted with VAG's tools.

VAG's tools have the unfortunate tendency of gluing files together when they shouldn't. The same thing happens with the new tool, I'm afraid.
I just wish he'd respond to my email

My russian is a bit rusty, but I think he's saying that it supports big/fat extraction, but not the BF sound extraction

Ah , I was wondering what he said.. He wrote all words without spaces for some reason. I have asked KorNet also to translate.

Most people on this forum, including the administrators, can't understand Russian. So humour us and use English like we all do.
