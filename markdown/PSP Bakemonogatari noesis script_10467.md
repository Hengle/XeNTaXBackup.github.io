How do you get the AMO/AMT files? All I seem to be finding are .AMC and .AMM files.

I'm stuck on this part too... even thou it throws an error it output some files ( mesh001.amg  - mesh0030.amg) i guess the script works but
now what next to do with the amg files? the follow up reply on that topic posted a script for converting it to 3ds file but it only works for dbz
I also try importing the null files directly to noesis by adding .amo extension to it and using the this bakemonogatari noesis script it doesnt work too.

anyone manage to use this script properly? don't want to be spoon feed but some help would be so much appreciated!
if anyone would like to give it a shot here are the files : [https://www.mediafire.com/#leaalw027gbva](https://www.mediafire.com/#leaalw027gbva)

sorry for bumping an old topic there were very limited resources about ripping models from this game. this one is my last hope.

Seeing this posted again reminds me something. I was having issues with the script and edited it so it worked. Here's the version I edited.

almost lost my hope on this. thank you so much sir! it works but there's a problem, face and hands are not included on the import. is this normal?are they stored on a separate file?  any idea how to spot them easily? i got 15k null files here and its a pain to open them one by one on hex editor.

The hands and faces are at the origin of the model (inside the stomach) and will need to be manually placed in a 3d software.

all amb files (bones?) of this game in case anyone needs it. [removed](removed)

and here are the  amo/amt files of all character models from this game ( spend my whole day manually lookin for them and sorting them) [removed](removed)

one last thing. is there any way to keep the texture and their placements when exporting the models? tried exporting it to obj but it doesn't generate material library file. I tried applying them manually on 3dsmax and its hopeless.

EDIT : oh fucking yes!!  I've manage to export the model with assigned textures by following this tutorial [https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-19706.html](https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-19706.html)

EDIT 2 : Here are the character models  in obj format with assigned textures. cheers!

Nice plugin. Having some issues with it though. Half the AMO files I have been able to extract don't work and give me a "File could not be previewed." error message when trying to open them as well as a "The file type could not be determined." error when trying to export them. I also tried with Finale00's plugin and ShadyTheFirst's edited version of this plugin to no avail. I strongly suspect these models are the location models (Eiko Cram School, Naoetsu High, Shirohebi Park, etc.), since I wasn't actually able to find them anywhere but was able to find the texture files for them. Unfortunately, it turns out they're the models I need the most.

found the problem: all of the files in question started with #AMB instead of #AMO, with the #AMO section being further down the file. Deleting everything before #AMO did the trick, and all of the files finally opened. It feels like they're missing stuff though.
See the screenshot below for example. These are clearly the stairs at the center of the Shirohebi Park, but where's everything else? Not to mention, the file is over half a megabyte, it'd be weird if it only had that inside, plus the texture file clearly has textures for a lot more stuff. I suspect the problem lies within the #AMB chunk I had to delete, but I'm not sure how to fix it.

Hey,
I searched these files everywhere and thanks to you that you extracted them from the game. The only problem is I can't use the model files in blender or unity (obj). There is an error:

Traceback (most recent call last):

Maybe someone can help me
Thanks, stay safe
