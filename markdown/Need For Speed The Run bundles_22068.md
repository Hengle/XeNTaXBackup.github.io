- Post Title: Need For Speed The Run bundles

Hi! 9 years ago EA released NFS The Run but still impossible to get 3d models from this game. Frosty Editor don't support The Run, Ninja ripper crashing UV and smooth. I found this topic: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7679](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7679) and extrarct files from The Run. I got compress files. Anybody have time for look and make script for this game? Thanks.

Hi! 9 years ago EA released NFS The Run but still impossible to get 3d models from this game.
What are you talking about? You sure searched long enough?
There has been a script since 2013: [http://www.bfeditor.org/forums/index.ph ... lefield-3/](http://www.bfeditor.org/forums/index.php?/forum/52-battlefield-3/)
And a new updated one as well: [https://github.com/NicknineTheEagle/Frostbite-Scripts](https://github.com/NicknineTheEagle/Frostbite-Scripts) which makes one above obsolete.
The game can be fully dumped and you can get any asset.
Also plugin for UU3D as well as tool by ID-daemon: [viewtopic.php?p=137476#p137476](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=137476#p137476)

RES extensions are wrong, you'd have to replace them accordingly if your familiar with Frostbite games structure of their assets, then it will all work.

Says on the github page: "ebxtoasset - runs through EBX files and uses known EBX types to extract assets from chunks, the resulting file takes the EBX name; currently, only sounds and movies are supported"

Only sounds and movies are supported, what good is the script if it doesn't work to reference the other assets?

The script does what it does, if your that unhappy, why don't you update it to support the rest of the formats? So we all can benefit, you think no one has ever proposed that to the dev in the past? Don't be ungrateful, everything we get here is already free of charge at each devs leisure time.
