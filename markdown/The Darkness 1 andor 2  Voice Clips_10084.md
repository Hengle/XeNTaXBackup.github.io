- Post Title: The Darkness 1 and/or 2  Voice Clips

Heres some info on the game
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Darkne ... eo_game%29](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Darkness_%28video_game%29)
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Darkness_II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Darkness_II)

I have the PS3 version of each one but would be willing to grab the 360 version if it would make ripping easier


What I'm wanting is the voices from the games main antagonist "The Darkness" which the game is named after. And maybe the voices of Jackie the main character.

If anyone's willing to help me out I'd appreciate it. I have some experience with ripping games using Psound and Goldwave and the lot so I'm not a TOTAL noob (is that what they call it these days) in fact I'm responsible for the MGS1 and 2 voice rips  that are floating around youtube.


But anyway. If this is against the rules you can go ahead and call me out. Just need a helping hand for a project im doing
