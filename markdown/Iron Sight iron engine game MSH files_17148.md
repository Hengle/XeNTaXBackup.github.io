I was given a bms script that decompresses the files for this game , textures are .dds and model files are MSH . Can someone tell me if there is a script to import MSH files to 3dmax . Thanks

Thank you, heads are working too. But could you upload more models? Like 20? I need to be sure everything is covered, 4 models aren't enough.

Here's maxscript for model import (3ds max 2011-2014), try it out and let me know about problems. I will fix them when I will have time!

Hello, I have problems with import some models. 
I get MaxScript error "Exceeded the vertex countSkin:skin" on line 242 when I tried to import this model for example.

Also, not a big problem, but all models I tried to import are mirrored, don't know is it script problem or engine specific feature.

When using the IronSight.ms script, after importing the various parts to create a character, I end up with multiple skeletons which function independently.

Is there a way to merge the .msh parts into the initial loaded skeleton?

Thanks zaramot for you time and effort.

my friend, is there anyway that i can import those .msh or .b3d files into blender? i DO really need those ironsight models ported to gmod but i'm having a trouble with them.

if u didn't find any, then it's fine, thanks for helping at least.

but if u want to help me by u going to import them to 3dmax opr automaya then export them as fbx and send them here to me, then that's much much appreciated!

that actually either because of the splitted vertices, or because of the marked seams. well that's what they called in blender. but if you export it as .FBX and import it into blender and check in edit mode, you might find out one of these i mentioned earlier.

I see.That's what I saw and use "clear double" and "clear seams" to fix them in the blender 2.80.
However,is it possible to have this maxscript updated ?...and to import animations?

erm... i have no idea my friend

i'm no expert in 3DSMax or auto maya. i mostly use blender most of my time to convert models to source engine games, like SFM, Gmod etc..
maybe it is possible, but you need to find someone who have that intelligent brain to make a script for importing Ironsight's model animations.
