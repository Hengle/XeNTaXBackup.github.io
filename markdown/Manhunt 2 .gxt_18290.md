hello guys...
is there any body to help me in edit manhunt2 .gxt? becuse i can change font and just need text

i know it's old, but i love this game and i can't do it by myself, just i don't about TDAT in this gxt
i could not edit it, my problem is UTF-16 and this game actually using local_windows system to set all characters, (some characters will be missing),
