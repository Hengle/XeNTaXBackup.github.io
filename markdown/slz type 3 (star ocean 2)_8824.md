Star ocean 3 (PS2) uses type 3 slz's from tri-ace

I found a tool that correctly decompresses the slz files, but would need a separate script to handle the pack files.

Here's the tool + source.
Would be great if it's added to quickbms.

Is this the same compression that the Yakuza games use?

no it is not. I hope this Friday binary domain on pc will use the same compression as the consoles did. If it does then we can extract it no problem.
