Can anyone extract the .ap archives for me from the Tex Murphy games. They contain movies that I cant figure out how to extract.  I tried adding an attachment for one of the files but it said the extension. AP wasnt allowed. Thanks

Compress the file with a tool like WinRAR or WinZip, then you should be able to attach it.
