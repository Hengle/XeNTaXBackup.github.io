- Post Title: Whacked! (2002) Game Archives .pak

I've recently been looking through old xbox games' files such as Mechassault 2: Lone Wolf, Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath (2005), Jet Set Radio Future and so on, and decided to dig through Whacked since it had a bunch of comical sounds that I still remember today. Apparently, the most common format is the ".pak" file which acts as a universal archive for different files: sounds, textures, 'bitmaps' and although I managed to get the music (which was in .saf format and was easily importable to GoldWave, I don't know how to unpack the .pak archives.) Any ideas? Thank you for your time!   

Here's a link to a zip with all the possible formats I could pack [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vmgr5wgf9lx10zg/Samples.zip?dl=0)
