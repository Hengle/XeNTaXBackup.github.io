- Post Title: Need help with decrypting save file from Overcrowded: Tycoon

The game features a pseudo-multiplayer mode that always puts the player in 1st place, so it's impossible to earn the trophy for finishing at 2nd or 3rd places (we have already been asking to credit us towards 2nd and 3rd trophies when scoring 1st for months but there hasn't been anything heard back), so please help me edit its save file.
Also, we haven't got an update in months, so it seems the game is abandoned at this point.
Link to save file:

Link to game's apk: [https://m.apkpure.com/overcrowded-tycoo ... vercrowded](https://m.apkpure.com/overcrowded-tycoon/com.zeptolab.overcrowded)
One can expect the decrypted save file to look like this, which is editable on saveeditonline.com : [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jtyL3r ... p=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jtyL3rIozCLnNJ_v-WAgLqbZHBXv5TqR/view?usp=drivesdk)
Thanks for the help! Please tell me if there's anything else I need to provide!

The game hasn't been updated in 6 months, and to be honest the cost for some upgrade packs to disable ads and auto-extract are outrageous (50 US dollars and 100 US dollars), so please help me decrypt its save file.
