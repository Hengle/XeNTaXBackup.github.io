- Post Title: Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 [.mix]

I've extracted soundfiles from the original Red Alert 2 and from The First Decade version with
XCC Utils. In both case I wasn't able to get the sound effects from the ra.mix file. All I have
are the voices. I don't know an alternative tool that can handle .mix files.

Does anybody know how to get the sound effects and which tool I have to use?
