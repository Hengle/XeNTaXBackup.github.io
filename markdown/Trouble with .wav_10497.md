I have the archive with music files. It seems that files in the archive are not compressed and packed as is. I've wrote the simple unpacker and get a bunch of wav files with correct headers and size, but any player can't play them. You can download three of them [here](http://gfile.ru/a19D9). Any suggestions?

No, PC

Upd. Ok, I solved the problem. Headers were not so correct, as I thought.
