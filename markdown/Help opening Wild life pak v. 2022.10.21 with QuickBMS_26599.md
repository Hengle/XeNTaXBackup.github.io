Hi Xentax modders! Hope everyone is doing well.

I downloaded the last UE4 version of Candy Valley Networks' Wild Life v. 2022.10.21 that runs on Windows 7, pre Unreal Engine 5.

Downloaded the game from here. [https://f95zone.to/threads/wild-life-pa ... teve.3810/](https://f95zone.to/threads/wild-life-patreon-build-24-02-2023-adeptus-steve.3810/)

I've done this for prior versions of this game and unpacked it with QuickBMS with no problems, as one already made script, "unreal_tournament_4.bms" worked because the prior versions were encrypted using this standard unreal encryption.  ̶S̶i̶n̶c̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶C̶V̶N̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶m̶a̶d̶e̶ ̶a̶ ̶p̶r̶o̶p̶r̶i̶e̶t̶a̶r̶y̶ ̶s̶o̶r̶t̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶e̶n̶c̶r̶y̶p̶t̶i̶o̶n̶  since then the unreal engine version was updated so that the  "unreal_tournament_4.bms" no longer works and returns this message.

Is there a way around this? Might there be anyone here who would be willing to guide me in making a custom script to unpack Wild Life?

Thanks for reading.

Solved, I read a little more on some other modding forums, turns out that I needed to use an updated unreal_tournament_4.bms script that was updated for (4.27) "unreal_tournament_4_0.4.27" it working great for unpacking this version of Wild Life.
