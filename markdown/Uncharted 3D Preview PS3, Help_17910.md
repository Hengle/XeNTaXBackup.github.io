You can use my tool for the ps4 remaster of the Uncharted games. It can preview/extract the models inside the pak files : [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17762](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17762)

If you need something specifically for the ps3 version, you can use daemon1's tool : [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=16499](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=16499) . There is no preview, but you can view them in a model viewer or something after extracting.
