- Post Title: Destiny 2 models?

Not sure if this is the right place or not, but Destiny 2 has been out for quite a while, and I know a few people got into the beta build, but what about the game as it is now?

As far as I'm aware, the awesome folks over on the Destiny 2 Ripping discord are the only ones around with models, you can find them here: [https://discord.gg/PhKSK9U](https://discord.gg/PhKSK9U)

The models they have come directly from Ninja Ripper and Lowlidev, so Ninja for the textures, low for models. They have some of the major NPCs and enemy types, and a couple of others and myself rig the models for peoples personal use. However its really not a good way to get the models, because the accounts they use to rip gets banned after three or four rips. So its pretty expensive, and I wanted to find a cheaper alternative for them.

That being said, our rips aren't the highest quality, but they're better then nothing. I was wonder why the amazing people here have gotten into so many difficult games like God Of War and what not, but still haven't gotten into Destiny 2? (Personally I assumed its a lack of interest)

My research ends up at people had a bit of difficulty with it because of it having I think two encryption keys? I'm not 100%, all I'm good at is making Shaders and making rigs for models, so I could be way off.

Either way, thanks for taking the time to read this.
