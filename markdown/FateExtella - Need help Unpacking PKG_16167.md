- Post Title: Fate/Extella - Need help Unpacking PKG

EDIT:
Full Game PKG DL Link (5GB) [https://goo.gl/AH6rTj](https://goo.gl/AH6rTj)
Small Sample PKG DL Link (22MB) [https://goo.gl/Z5bafz](https://goo.gl/Z5bafz)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sup all, so I managed to extracted the PKG files of Fate/Extella: The Umbral Star off of my PS4 but (for the love of God) I CANNOT unpack these PKG files using all the normal tools found on the internet.
So if anyone can help crack these babies open then by all mean, please do... 

I'll attached the small PKG file here so you can give it a try and if you manage to unpack it then please tell us (me) how you did it... though it's very likely that you'll need to write a new program/script to unpack it.

Example of PKG File [https://mega.nz/#!kHhjza6R!yHc2ElK5wqID ... 0epJezpf1U](https://mega.nz/#!kHhjza6R!yHc2ElK5wqIDA2bA_yYPXM6KBai6JHRsn0epJezpf1U)

This is one of the 3 pkg files from the game.
I'll have a link to the other 2 on this post by tomorrow cuz it's like 5GB so I'll let it upload overnight.

Fate/Extella screenshots






As you can see, these models are an upgrade to the Fate/Extra and Fate/Extra CCC models... As a fan of the fate franchise, I think it's WAY overdue for higher quality model for our favorite waifus.

its not possible to extract ps4 pkg's without the rif key.
The only way to get a rif key is with a ps4 on the latest firmware with a kernel exploit. (This does not exist currently)
the vita version could be dumped is someone has it on their vita (any firmware)

I used PSXDownloadHelper...
Just do a quick Google search on it cuz it's fairly easy to use... but the files is still encrypted so you can't extract everything from the PKG files.
