- Post Title: Which multiplayer games you play

Do you play online? If so, which games are your favourite? 

I used to play Counterstrike and Unreal Tournament a whole lot, the first even in a clan for a brief period; two actually, DEO (Destructive Extremist Organization) and AO (Always Online), a fake all-women clan, that used the "Always" protective pad company logo....The chat-ups you get in CS when you're a woman.... 

I also played Battlefield, Return to Castle Wolfenstein a lot, and some C&C Generals. 

If you see someone named The Age Of Chaos, or The Age, that'll probably be me kicking your ass in some online game...

online games? sure, I play 'em
mmo? never, only single player (except Warcraft 3's Battlenet and Yu-gi-oh!)

I play flash games, but not the kind of cat with bow golf or indestructo tank (ok, I admit it, I like them too)
What I play most are games made by Artix Entertainment, like Adventure Quest, Dragonfable and Mechquest (for Mechquest, I have written a guide, the only places the guide is allowed to be uploaded are neoseeker and gamefaqs .com).
I was also persuaded to play CS by my friends and cousin but I hate FPS so I quit in three days...

I'm into RPGs, Adventure games (both 1st and 3rd person), RTS (Warcraft and Civilization mostly) and other random games, I may like a game that is let's say...tennis...it depends...I also like Trading Card Games like the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG.
Anything works if I'm bored though...okay, almost everything.

I used to play Runescape a lot, and for a while, I tooled around on Guild Wars... other than that, though, I don't play much online (unless Wikipedia counts  ). Generally, though, I like FPS, Action, Puzzle (sometimes), RPG, Racing, and occasionally, Golf. And I hate RTS with a vengeance (I don't like the whole micromanagement angle... although I *do* enjoy a good customization system in a racing game... wierd...). Mostly.

Oh, but RTS is soo cool. There's nothing like starting a game of, say, StarCraft, play for 3 hours on end and come out the Glorious Victor out of 8 players. My friends and I have had some classic, excellent battles among eachother. StarCraft, Red Alert 2, C&C: Generals, some brilliant tactics have been displayed by all of us at times, and that makes it really cool.

I know how cool RTS can be, but I just hate all the buildup necessary... I'm the type who prefers tojump right in and start slaughtering stuff, whether figuratively or literally... I guess you could call me the "one-man army" type.  

As for the Sims, I've played a couple of the games some, and can't say I particularly enjoy them... More micromanagement and all that... *bleagh*

Well, Dinoguy, perhaps C&C: Generals or C&C3 is more to your liking, I found that you can play rather quick battles, with less lenghty build-up stages (whole battles lasting under 1 hour).

As for upcoming games, I'm looking forward to Spore, to see if it will indeed be that special. I hope Bethesda Softworks are gonna create a Fall Out 3 that lives up to the Fall Out universe, and I hope they soon start on Elder Scrolls 5.  

I'm also looking forward to StarCraft 2 and Diablo 3, both excellent in multiplayer, as I hear there's the focus on co-op play in Diablo 3.
