- Post Title: Wolcen Lords of Mayhem : Decrypt .PAK archive from CryEngine

Hi,
The game [Wolcen Lords of Mayhem](http://store.steampowered.com/app/424370/) is currently in alpha and will support modding.
We can already edit xml files to make mods.
But in order to make more complex mods, we will need to know how the game is working.
If we can decrypt/uncompile some .pak file made in CryEngine, this will greatly help because we don't need compiled pak files to make them work in the game.
For example has anyone been able to decrypt the scripts.pak archive or know how it could be done ?
