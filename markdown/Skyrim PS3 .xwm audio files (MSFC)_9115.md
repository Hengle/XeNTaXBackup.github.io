- Post Title: Skyrim PS3 .xwm audio files (MSFC)

Hey guys,

I'm having a bit of trouble converting the Skyrim PS3 .xwm audio files to .wav, and I'm hoping someone can help with this. The .xwm files have a small header tag of MSFC, but when I treat the file as an MSF file as used in other games, the file is empty which can't be right. I've been at this for hours and I'm stumped. Any help getting this file type converted would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

Updated my old msf2at3 script, seems to work perfectly fine: [viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4450&p=43570#p43570](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4450&p=43570#p43570)
Install the Atrac codec to open at3 files in any audio editor that uses the Windows codec library. Sony SoundForge also has a batch processing tool, which help if you want to convert multiple files in one sweep.
