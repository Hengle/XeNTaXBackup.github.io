- Post Title: Car Mechanic Simulator 2018 .cms

Hello, I was wondering if it's possible to make a QuickBMS script/program to unpack the .cms archives from Car Mechanic simulator 2018.
It is a Unity3D game. I attach the plugin used in Unity3D to create the archive.


 CMS18CarExporter2.zip
CMS 2018 Unity3D Plugin (1.72 KiB) Downloaded 56 times


Here there is a Mod (not mine) made using that script: [https://sharemods.com/9rvvcwwe6pm2/corv ... n.rar.html](https://sharemods.com/9rvvcwwe6pm2/corvettec266_svensyn.rar.html)

Thanks in advance

You can use [UnityEx](http://forum.zoneofgames.ru/topic/36240-unityex/) for import/export from .cms file. It's normal UnityFS archive with changed very first byte from "UnityFS" to "SnityFS".

Thank you for your answer.
I used an HEX editor and then I opened the file.
Any idea how or where to import the ".mesh" files?

Thanks

Guys, *.cms file is generic Unity Asset with custom header. CMS's devs using "SnityFS" instead of "UnityFS" identificator in the file header. Just replace the first byte in the cms file and open in any tool like AssetStudio-GUI. Extract all contents and enjoy)
