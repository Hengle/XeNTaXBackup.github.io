Where did you get THIS .xwb file from? It's the oldest xwb Version (Version 1)  I'v ever seen. So far, I only saw Versions 42-44. And that's one of the problems: most .xwb tools support only some versions. You chose unxwb, which is probably the best xwb tool available, as it supports all versions, but looking into the source code, it might have problems with Version 1.
You are aware, that you have to use it from the command line?
Just put the Canon_music.xwb in the same directory as unxwb.exe and type
unxwb Canon_music.xwb
You may also try
unxwb -a Canon_music.xwb

A little offtopic, but a personal request  : the only thing, that unxwb does not do is extracting WMA data from xwb files to valid .wma files. A while ago I posted a question in [this thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=4391).. I'd be very thankful if someone could answer me
