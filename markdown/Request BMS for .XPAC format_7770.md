- Post Title: Request: BMS for .XPAC format

Hello.

I've been looking for a .xpac unpacker and have been suggested by a friend to request one from this forum, so it goes.

I very soon need to unpack .xpac files from Sonic and SEGA All-Stars Racing, a game developed by SEGA. There is a file called Racers.xpac on the PC version which very probably contains the character models. I have the sufficient programs to rip the models I need with rigs. So I just need an unpacker.

I'm basically looking for any .xpac unpacker, which can extract files from the works of Sumo Digital. But preferably, a BMS for quickBMS would be the best since it's easy to use.

I will wait as long as it takes you to code/make the unpacker if you are sure you can do this.
I'm willing to send you the Racers.xpac which is 100 megabytes if you need it while working.

After the work, I'm highly willing to share my rigged model rips with you. So your help will be rewarded.

Thanks.
