- Post Title: Brutal legend 3D model and texture files

After using an Hex editor i have seen the word mesh at the begining so i suppose this mean the format of the file.
So i searched on the web for .mesh files and how to open but no luck for open just seen mesh format for ogre3D engine.
and still dunno for the texture file.
