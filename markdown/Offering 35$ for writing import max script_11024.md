- Post Title: Offering 35$ for writing import max script

As the topic says i'm offering 35$ to anyone who will write me a ms script or plugin that will support "autoskinning", bones, weights etc. Current importer i've got is limited, so that we can basically call it mesh importer since it won't autoskin anything, even though geometry binary file format stores all the info needed for this. 
If you're interested ill send you all needed files including current plugins, part of source and game files, just pm me first ;d 

Unfortunately the uploaded plugins will work only on the outdated version of 3ds max they were bound to. My offer is valid only if we do it via PM - means, if you'll get the script ready, send me some examples that files were imported correctly and i'll send you money via paypal, then you'll send me your script, must be compatible with since my exporter is bound to this version. 
Prefer only trustworthy users, with decent amount of posts. Sorry for all the mistakes in the terminology, hope you understand what i need.

P.S Not sure if that matters, but the game that models are from is really old and totally unknown, so no need to be worry cuz I'm not asking you to get me a script for tera/aion or any similar game

//Little change of plans, from now on i'll pay 15$ for the import script only, don't need export script anymore. I'm in serious need of this script, so if you can help be i'll be really grateful and will gladly pay

Send pm to Mr. Adults and offer the $15 USD, i shure he can do this.

On second thought, don't do that, because MrAdults doesn't do those kinds of requests and I shouldn't be volunteering him like this because it's really rather impolite of me.

I don't really want to offend anyone with my offer but I guess it's much more sensible than asking you all to do it for free. So far no1 is interested, go ahead spread the info all over the world of xentax

Send me the format/script you have, and I'll see what I can do. 
If only the weight information is missing, that should be very easy. You didn't say if the current script import bones, though.
I don't care about the money.

This is why I apologized for lack of knowledge in naming "things I need":o You could always ask ^^

Well current plugin can actually import meshes/bones/animations but its missing "autoskinning" or idk how to call it ^^ but when I import a mesh + its bones/animations, the mesh isn't skinned at all, and this is what I need, cuz when I import a mob or armor part its practically useless and has to be skinned/weighted from 0 which is pointless since model stores all the info to "autoskin" the mesh while importing.

I'm not interested in the money.
Anyway some thoughts to share.

From the video (gues you made it?) the problem seems to be interesting.

But looks like someone had to start from scratch.

With blender I could import the armor mesh Cw_4_a01.gb without UVs.

The Tw_bone.gb does not make much sense to me:
[](http://www.pic-upload.de/view-21664217/Tw_bone.gb.jpg.html)

The 3 animations were imported but all I got were armature/pose entries in the Outliner window, no structures.

The Visual Studio projects for the Max im-/exporter would be more valuable if they were complete.

Atm in the exporter project these files are missing for example:
#include "Max.h"
#include "stdmat.h"
#include "decomp.h"
#include "cs/bipexp.h"
#include "cs/Phyexp.h"
#include "iparamm2.h"
#include "iskin.h"


Having a compileable importer project we could think about changing it into a Max-independend importer for example.
But that's just a guess.

Last not least: you didn't mention the author of the Max import/export projects.
Are the sources public?

First of all thanks for your interest ^^ Some part of the only public sources is in the package that I uploaded and these are the official sources (leaked from the game owners somehow)
About the cash i'm offering, well since i'm not able to contribute with my knowledge, to make myself look "more acceptable" and also asking you all to make this script for free isn't right, i just decided to pay someone to do this. Obviously I offended some of you with my topic already and i'm sorry for that cuz it wasn't my intention. 

Current import plugin is really limited, i'd even say it's retarded  Once imported armours/monsters are totally useless, they can't be exported back to the game cuz of missing skin etc

Short description of previously attached import/export plugins:
Blender import/export - unofficial plugins created by the guy who quited the scene long time ago, source not released
3dsmax import - unofficial plugin created by one of scene modelers, source not released
3dsmax export - offcial plugin created by game owners, source or part of it leaked together with compiled plugin

Thanks to your tip about missing files i found this two pretty huge folders(more than 300mb after unpacking oO) anyway i think that might be it, tons of sources and other stuff included, sadly it's still missing most parts of import source...

Well okay my bad, never worked with blender to be honest and i'm not familiar with any coding language^^ 
Little edit: So it actually supports what i need? Since it's blender script maybe someone could rewrite it to be compatible with noesis ;d

Edit vol2: Just imported some armour parts in blender and indeed it does what i need, unfortunately i couldnt export it to any suitable format that would support rigged models which i could import to 3ds max later (collada,fbx,smd doesnt work at least for me -,-)

So yea guys i guess you got a nice base to work on, i mean the blender import plugin xD Get me the damn max script or plugin now please :O

Here's a download link for this plugin, thanks to shakotay for finding fixed one

You have more chances or getting your problem solved by posting/searching why the blender export doesn't work than with this:

> Get me the damn max script or plugin now please :O

Blender has export for 3ds, even in the old 2.4 version, have you tried that? 
If it doesn't work, you cant ry to save the file and open it with the newest version 2.69 and try to export it from there.

I just installed the client today. But the name of the bones and meshes don't match! how do you know which bones belongs to which?

Also, I notice on data/config/config.pk is a passworded zip. and seems to have the data I needed. Do you know the password?

Thanks for the info, but they are kinds of useless to me.
I am only interested in the games which are mod-able ATM.
So I need to know the password/how to found the password, so I can edit the dat files inside config.pk.

And the files you converted had problems as well, some characters just converted as ??.
It means some data lost!

Also some files like data/Config/ClientVer.dat had encrypted. Is there decrypt/encrypt program for that?

Could you explain what means mod-able for you?^^ Cuz editing any values makes sense only if you got a ready to launch server files and this won't work with this client,server files are outdated and you'd have to use old client to run a pserv.

PS. Thanks for calling my huge as fck post useless xD

That's a good question, maybe it was supposed to be like that no idea. So if i understood right, you've made some progress with importing gbs to max?^^ I somehow can't open the fbx you provided (using max 2012)

//Got it, bones are too big and couldnt see the model, but now i see it's skinned, so weird to see a progress finally

Yeah, I imported all models you provided in previous post. Still, I need more samples since I'm sure there will be other differences for new models. Here's armour in .psk format maybe it will work better for you

Here's a source package reupload cuz previous link is dead, these are the official tuts/docs/sources/compiled files from game owners, missing import sources 
[http://www.multiupfile.com/f/947da63e](http://www.multiupfile.com/f/947da63e)

For more file samples you should download full game client, files aren't packed so you just need to look through folders to get files
And that's right there are many different in the client, so if there will be any questions feel free to ask ill try to explain everything as accurate as possible.

Shouldn't boot mesh move along with the bone, since it's skinned? or its just cuz of this psk format?

And well the most important question are you going to finish the import plugin/script so we could "finalize" the 35$ deal?^^

I already have a client, drop items are working. But I think I will not support land, trees or terrain. Just Player models, Monsters and NPC, maybe some other files you mentioned about would work too.

Hi! So, here's maxscript to import models. I tried a lot of them, and got bored lol So, now it's up to you. If you want load models like weapons/dropitems and those like a bridge on the pic. Just skip first pop-up window (bone import part) and import mesh with a second window (some may not work xD).

Woot nice ;d some things i've noticed so far:

-after import models/bones lie on the ground every model/bones position is fixed in file somehow, and they basically "stand"
-how to skip this 1st window?:p
-no chance to import anims? tried to import them with mine importer and max crashed, needed much

Can you export animation in .fbx (few samples)? I don't have 3ds max 8 to use old plugin

2 samples for now, if you need more or if anything is wrong with those let me know.

other samples in .max format, this is how it should look after import (base position of mesh/bone/anims) otherwise it wouldn't be possible to export them back to the game.

Doesn't work and its not supposed to cuz it's animated armor, i'd need a skinned mesh only without animation then i could try to export it.

Looks ok to me, a bit not in the place where they should be but that's cuz i had to pose them myself as there was no fixed position after importing fbx, tried to match as much as possible ;d Animation also affects armor parts, so i'm 90% sure that's ok atm

Ah, that's pretty much everything I planned to do with this game. Let's leave animation for someone more interested.

Here's two scripts, one for skinned meshes and one for static meshes (*no_bones.ms). You must rotate all objects 90 degrees on X axis using working pivot+"angle snap toggle", to make them stand (if I make them auto-standing with script, animation works bad, don't know why xD).

Edit: Fixed script for some map meshes
